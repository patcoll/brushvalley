<p>A recent editorial in The News-Item suggested a number of reasons why a referendum (in November) on the proposed federal prison in Northumberland County would not be appropriate despite numerous requests by members of the public. Let's review these points a little more closely. 

<p>First of all, the opinion was authored by a rather vocal proponent of the prison project, so impartiality was probably not a great consideration when the piece was written. But in all fairness to the editor, this letter is written by a large proponent for saving Brush Valley! 

<p>The first of four reasons given that a referendum may not work is that the prison project may not affect the entire county, so why should citizens of areas like Milton, Sunbury, or Turbotville have an opinion on the matter? For starters, if I lived in any of these areas, I would be extremely angry about being treated like a second-class citizen. After all, these residents are a part of our county and our country for that matter! Isn't it our federal government that wants to use our federal taxes ($150 million) to build this prison? And isn't it our county that has been negotiating with Consumers Water to pay nearly $4.7 million of our county money to buy a pristine watershed for demolition? Wasn't it our county that paid at least $10,000 of our money to Consumers Water to just hold the land? Isn't it our county that has made claims that this project will certainly create jobs throughout our entire county, not just in Coal Township? And isn't it our entire county that would benefit from a 2,000 acre public park and open space? 

<p>The second reason suggests that a referendum might scare the Bureau of Prisons away. I didn't realize that the federal government was so skittish. Honestly, a referendum should have been placed on the ballot a long time ago, before any of our county money was spent! Once again, the county has tried to shove something down the throats of residents claiming that it is for our own good! (Remember that 132 percent tax increase they wanted to impose?) Well commissioners, maybe we are tired of hearing what you think we want and instead would like the opportunity to say what we really want! Think about it. The county is claiming that the majority of Northumberland County wants this prison. Why are they so afraid to put it on the ballot? 

<p>The editor's third reason suggests that a referendum would simply be redundant since the Bureau of Prisons offers ample opportunity for residents to express their opinions. Hogwash! The meeting that was held by the Bureau of Prisons last May was nothing more than a pep rally fueled by our county government. I think it is interesting that the key players of the pro-prison gang (the politicians, businessmen, the Chamber, etc.) all had an opportunity to speak before the general public. Are their words more valuable than ours? In fact, we know how they feel. They have the ears of the media. They took up valuable time that the public could have had to voice their opinions. Not everyone at that meeting had a chance to speak, but all our politicians did! What democracy! By the way, who paid for the "Federal Prison: Yes" signs (clever slogan, I am sure it took the Big Boys some time to come up with it)? I would hate to think that those were paid with our county money! Maybe the county would be interested in funding some BVPA signs for the Sept. 18 meeting. I already know what they'll say: "Federal Prison: No!" Second thought, I think we'll just make our own! 

<p>The fourth reason why a referendum wouldn't work according to the editor: We voted them in so we should just let the decisions up to our elected officials. Obviously, the words grass roots are not in the editor's vocabulary. Don't we have a right to question things and disagree with decisions that are being made for us? If it wasn't for active citizens and the legal efforts of Mr. Saylor taking our county to court, our taxes would have been raised 132 percent when Cwalina and Lewis proposed the outrageous increase. Our elected officials do not always make the right decisions. It is the public that must determine when to intervene. Of course, the editor did have a good point. If we don't like the decisions our officials make, we can vote them out of office. Ahhhh, democracy!
