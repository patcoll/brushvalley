<b>OWNERSHIP</b><br>
Proposed site acreage is owned by Roaring Creek Division of Consumers Water Company.  Additional acreage with 
adjacent properties that may be available are owned by:<br>
Roaring Creek Water<br>
Burnrite Coal Company<br>
Susquehanna Coal Company<br>
<br>'Right of Entry' forms have been signed for two of the three 
ownership firms involved.  This means that owners would consider 
negotiations for sale of portions of subject properties.  Signing 
of third form is pending.
<p>
<b>USE</b><br>Currently all site properties are undeveloped land with 
some surface mining and some deep mining.  Some mine reclamation 
has been done.  A large portion of site area is free of surface 
mining, deep mining, and feasible recoverable coal deposits.                             
<p>
<b>SITE CONCERNS</b><br>We with BVPA believe that site concerns relating 
to coal within and adjacent to this site can feasibly be eliminated.
<br>	1. Remaining coal deposits are not of sufficient quality or 
	quantity to justify economical recovery.<br>
	2. Remnants of surface mining can easily be reclaimed.<br>
	3. Remnants of deep mining are few and problems can be overcome.<br>
	4. A portion of site under coal lease can be negotiated for 
	availability.<br>
<p>
<b>WATER</b><br>Near 8000 feet from water main near Natalie.
<p>
<b>GAS</b><br>Natural, four inch, medium pressure (30-60psi) line at 
Foster Wheeler Co-Gen Plant.  About two miles from site.
<p>
<b>STEAM</b><br>
Foster Wheeler Mount Carmel Inc. can supply a significant volume of steam available at any 
usable pressure or temperature for a distance of two to three miles.
<p>
<b>ELECTRIC</b><br>
Foster Wheeler Mount Carmel Inc. can provide electric power beginning in September of 2010.
<p>
<b>NOTES:</b>                                                                                                                    
<p>
	1. Per 'Brush Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce', The 
'Federal Bureau of Prisons' will not build on heavily scarred or 
undermined ground.<br>
	This 'Natalie East Site' cannot in any manner be considered 
as heavily scarred, and large areas of this site are not undermined.  
Possibly no deep mining in site area.<br>
<p>
	2. Consider Schuylkill County, our neighbor with similar 
terrain conditions, their valleys have state parks and their 
mountain tops have prisons.<br>
