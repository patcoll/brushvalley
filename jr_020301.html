The federal prison that one day may come to our area is being touted as the savior of our area's economy. Newspaper articles from entities in the area report that local businesses will flourish from the products and services that the federal prison will procure from area merchants. 

<p> But I see the opposite is more likely to happen as I do more research into the Department of Prisons UNICOR Industries. UNICOR is the trade name for Federal Prison Industries Inc. Its primary mission is the productive employment of inmates incarcerated within the federal prison system. The products manufactured by UNICOR are sold to government agencies only. This means the products made at UNICOR Industries will be purchased by the federal prison and not from local merchants. 

<p> The range of products and services available to the prison system through UNICOR is quite extensive. I'll list only a few. Take note. These items, manufactured at federal prisons by inmates, will be provided to the federal prison through UNICOR and will not be purchased at local businesses. 

<p> Coffee mugs, mouse pads, brooms, brushes, gloves, computer toner cartridges, desks, office chairs, filing cabinets, tables, beds, mattresses, printing, letterheads, envelopes, wall art, wall signs, name tags, office supplies, food service equipment, steel shelving, eyeglasses, safety glasses, electronic items, bed sheets and blankets, custom draperies and cleaning supplies. I just mentioned a few items of the massive inventory of products available to the federal prison system through UNICOR. 

<p> I do agree that prisoners should work and be kept active while in prison. I also would ask that local merchants look into UNICOR Industries at www.unicor.com and then ask yourself this question: How will my business prosper from a federal prison? Then you can ponder this thought: How will my business benefit if I would support the plan being offered by the Brush Valley Preservation Association? 

<p> What is our plan? 

<p> 1. A park in Brush Valley that will bring tourists and visitors into our area who will buy products and services from our local merchants. 

<p> 2. To locate the federal prison at Natalie. The prison could be the start of the infrastructure needed to bring other industry into the Natalie area. 

<p> 3. To keep the cogeneration facility in Marion Heights in business after 2010, thereby saving the possible loss of 125 jobs. 

<p> 4. To provide a better quality of life for the residents of eastern Northumberland County along with a potential for more employment opportunities for everyone without regard to age, gender or education. 

<p> 5. To check the reckless spending habits of our majority county commissioners. This land at Natalie could be purchased from the owner for a fraction of the cost of Brush Valley, thereby possibly keeping our taxes from increasing further. (Your property tax went up 70 percent last year in anticipation of buying the 2,000 acres to build the prison on.) 

<p> 6. To give the residents of our area a place, within five minutes of Shamokin, to have safe fun for camping, hiking, walking, swimming, picnicking, bike riding and relaxing. 

<p> By following this plan, our area will grow and prosper. To follow the plan of putting a prison in Brush Valley will lead to disaster. We have done extensive research on all aspects of the prison issue. We are prepared to discuss our plan with anyone interested. Please contact us at P.O. Box 301, Shamokin.
