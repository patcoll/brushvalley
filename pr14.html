Proponents of the development, and therefore destruction of Brush Valley have made many claims and statements recently in an attempt to bolster their case.  The Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) has found many of these claims to be exaggerated, biased, or simply wrong.  The BVPA would like to take this opportunity to clarify some of these issues with the facts and information that we have gathered  and believe to be true.

<p>Claim: A federal prison in Brush Valley would substantially boost the local economy because of the 300 to 350 excellent paying positions it would create and the associated "ripple effect" that is sure to follow, just as the state prison has done, benefiting every resident.

<p>BVPA findings: According to Pa. Dept. of Labor statistics the population and the ranking of wages as compared with the rest of the state have actually fallen for Northumberland County after the opening of SCI Coal Township. Also, it should be known that figures taken from the Bureau of Prison's own web site list the starting salary at about $22,000, not the often heard 30 plus.  BVPA has also talked to several BOP employees that
agree that because of the high entrance standards(four year college degree or three years of military service) plus the fact that so many local people already work for the prison system, the net gain in jobs would be closer to 125-150.

<p>Aside from that small number of new employees, the rest of the county would actually be paying for the prison.  As with the state prison, deals are being talked about where such things as free sewer lines and reduced sewer rates are being promised to lure the federal prison.  Your tax money will be used to maintain the roads, ensure fire and emergency services, even expand the schools for the children of relocating workers. Your county will go further in debt to purchase the land.  All this for a facility that doesn't pay local taxes.      A walk through down town Shamokin will confirm to anyone what all the area prisons have done for our economy... nothing.

<p>Although BVPA supports a prison somewhere in our area, we don't believe the possible benefits justify the loss of Brush Valley, or the cost to area residents. 

<p>Claim:  Brush Valley is private property and the water company can do with it as they please, including selling it for some other use, therefore area residents have no say in the matter.                

<p>BVPA believes:  This is only partially true.  It must be remembered that for years the water company has tried to sell Brush Valley but by their own admission it would be to expensive for most companies to develop. Even the construction of the state prison and it's infrastructure has not attracted any buyers other than the county. There are also many
environmental regulations that would limit development of such a sensitive piece of land no matter what the use would be. BVPA has in fact learned, through a third party conservation group, that the owners of Brush Valley would be interested in selling it for
recreation if there was local political support. Through everything we have learned we believe there is no doubt that Brush Valley could be obtained for a local park and open land, however, certain local "leaders" are dead set against this. As to whether or not local people have a say in this it should be remembered that it is YOUR tax money, both county and federal, that will pay for this project, and it is YOUR community that will be affected economically, environmentally, and socially.  You DO have a say!

<p>Claim: All plans are preliminary and under negotiation, so details can't be released.
 
<p>BVPA believes:  With the help of Attorney Tom Linzey the BVPA has been able to force the county to finally turn over documents relating to their intention to purchase Brush Valley.  They included a specific set price ($4.79 million), preliminary studies, and even detailed drawings of a high security complex.  These plans were made at least as early as
1998. 

<p>Claim:  Since reclaimed lands can't be used for construction, destruction of our 'green fields' is the only way to get industry. 

<p>BVPA believes:  In a letter dated September 6th,2000, from Congressman Kanjorski, to one of our members, Mr. Kanjorski writes about using available grants to reclaim land. "It is my intention that this land will spur economic development in the anthracite region be making this land available for commercial use as well  as private development." BVPA has continued to promote it's Natalie East site for a prison and other industry. It could have everything needed for an industrial park, including heat and electricity provided by a local employer, Foster
Wheeler.   

<p>Claim: BVPA 'jumped the gun' by using an attorney to obtain public documents from the county. 

<p>BVPA believes:  BVPA had made numerous calls to obtain these documents over several weeks with no results.  We had also learned that requests for the purchase agreement made by County Commissioner Sam Deitrich were ignored by the county.  BVPA then sent e-mail and written requests that were answered finally by County solicitor James Zurich.  He wrote back stating "please be assured it(the request) will be discussed at the next meeting of the corporation.  The corporation is not currently scheduled to meet in the near future but an answer to your request will be forthcoming as soon as that occurs." The BVPA must consider this delay the same as a denial, and will treat any such denials of public information the same way, by using any and all rights under the law to
obtain these documents.
                             
<p>This is just some of the information the BVPA has been gathering.  We are in the process of requesting more documents dealing with Brush Valley and Northumberland County finances. As more facts and information become available we plan to release it to the public. BVPA would like to remind the public that under the right to know law all citizens have the right to the access of public documents, and should consider becoming
involved in the Brush Valley issue, as well as other government concerns,  including the up and coming elections.
