Over the last few months there have been many issues raised regarding the proposed 
Brush Valley prison. Naturally most of the concern has centered on the environmental catastrophe that would be the end result of such construction. Also, many people are rightfully upset about the fiscal burden of floating the bond to pay for this project. Both are valid worries, and the BVPA (Brush Valley Preservation Association) is continuing to fight to preserve Brush Valley with these issues at the core of our struggle. However, through our many contacts and investigations we have found other problems that may be even more detrimental to the long term well being of our area...these being the lack of responsibility of our elected leaders to the average citizen, and the apathy that these politicians need in order avoid their responsibility to their citizens.

<p>First of all, our county has no direction, it hasn't for a long time. The county planning department is budgeted for $67,000, but the best plan we have is to pave over the crown jewel of Northumberland County, Brush Valley. Our planners need to look at the big picture and actually PLAN for the future, something that they haven't done in the past.

<p>Also, it is really ironic that we spend $50,000 a year for a tourism board and their best idea is to market the coal bank and other eye sores as attractions. And lets get this clear right now, they are eyesores! Instead of honoring the few men that got rich on coal and the destruction and pain that it has caused this area, let's honor the proud memory of the people and their families who worked and died in the mines. They are the real heroes, and I'll bet if you could ask them they'd tell you they'd rather be remembered with a beautiful, clean park than by some dirty, ugly pile of dirt, the very thing that may have
killed them. I say the valley should be developed into such a park, and it should be called the "Anthracite Memorial Park" in their honor. Of course this may never happen, again because our "leaders" have no concern for the wishes of the average person.

<p>We have been told over and over how destroying Brush Valley will benefit our community, but in reality only a handful will benefit. When you add up the estimated 150 new positions and the temporary construction jobs, plus the few (very few) vendor contacts and small amount of residual revenue, you are left with over 89,000 OTHER people in Northumberland County who will NOT benefit.

<p>These people will, however, pay taxes to cover the bond, put up with what ever negatives the the prison causes, lose their best and only natural resource (Brush Valley) and the positives this resource would have provided, both recreational and economic. Again, our leaders are not making decisions for the good of the whole.

<p>Of course some politicians, land developers, solicitors, large business owners, and other well connected people may get ahead, but unfortunately that has come to be expected in Northumberland County. 

<p>Many things have come to be expected in our area. We have been beaten down by the idea that because we live in an economically depressed community we are some how not worthy of the basic opportunities that others in our state and country enjoy. How often
have you heard or even said yourself "that's good money for around here"? Why is it good for us but substandard for everyone else? We understand the economic situation of Northumberland County, but we need to start believing that our people DO deserve good jobs, a clean environment, and the same high quality of life that all Americans have a
right to. We have got to stop using "eh, what are ya goin to do?" as our motto.

<p>In the last few months BVPA has found no reason why we can't have a prison in our area, Brush Valley acquired for a park, and other desirable business brought to Northumberland County...except for the lack of leadership. How then can we make our elected officials accountable to ALL of us? How can we stop our local government from
benefitting only a selected few over and over? Fortunately we have some powerful tools to help us take back our County. The Internet, telephone, and the post box are particularly effective. Public opinion is a great force for making change and these mediums convey it well. However, the best way to regain control of your community is to become aware,
informed, and VOTE! If you agree with what is going on in our area, by all means vote for the same people again. But if you disagree, know that you can make a difference.

<p>No matter what becomes of Brush Valley, be it park or prison, the people of BVPA hope that at least this controversy begins a new era for our community. We hope people realize that becoming interested and involved is not futile, but is the only way to govern ourselves, and insure the best life for all our citizens.
