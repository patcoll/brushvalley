<p>According to John R. Faraguna, President of the Brush Valley Preservation Association, the group may be forced to take legal action against Northumberland County for their failure to comply with the Open Records Law that requires state agencies to disclose public documents.  According to Faraguna, the BVPA has been attempting to obtain documents through the County's Financial Office regarding bond and other financial issues relating to both the General Authority and the Northumberland County Development Corporation for several weeks.  The county employer responsible for maintaining the documents, Mrs. Purcell, and Solicitor Jim Zurick have been uncooperative in providing the documents to the BVPA, despite numerous contacts with BVPA's attorney Tom Linzey.  Atty Linzey has advised the group to file a lawsuit against the County 

<p>Earlier in the year, the county had failed to provide the option agreement and other documents to BVPA after several requests made by the group. Only when Atty Tom Linzey contacted the county and got the ball rolling did the county release the appropriate materials.  

<p>BVPA's Vice-President, Nicole Dormer, stated how important these documents were in understanding the county's potential plan to purchase Brush Valley.  "Up until reading the option agreement and other documents provided by the County, no one knew exactly how much the county was willing to pay for that land, now we know. . it's important information that should be released to the public."

<p>John R. Faraguna is now publicly requesting that all involved in the ongoing Brush Valley and county finance situation meet to discuss related issues.
