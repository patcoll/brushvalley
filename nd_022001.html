The BVPA has been branded "anti-prison" in recent editorials. Why? For simply disclosing facts. 

<p> To be perfectly honest, BVPA was not established to fight for or against a prison. We formed to save Brush Valley, and in essence, our community. However, as in all great endeavors, it is important to explore all options and learn everything you can about the players involved. 

<p> What did we learn? Two very important truths: 

<p> 1) The proponents of the prison have only one vision. Destroy Brush Valley, no matter what alternate sites are available, no matter the cost to the taxpayer, or the environment. 

<p> 2) The benefits of a prison, as proclaimed by prison proponents, do not add up. 

<p> Across the nation, profiles of prison communities consistently illustrate a decline in the local economy, an overwhelming strain on infrastructure, and a decrease in real estate values. 

<p> BVPA believes these facts to be vital information. I suppose proponents of the prison expect us to keep our mouths closed and pretend that the prison is the solution to all our problems. Well, what if it isn't? What if we destroy Brush Valley only to learn years from now, that the prison did not live up to all the promises? 

<p> Fast forward 10 years to find no new businesses, no net gain in employment, as well as a decline in quality of life. Would the loss of Brush Valley still be worth it? 

<p> BVPA is not indebted to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Our loyalty is to the community in which we live. Perhaps we should ask ourselves, where does the loyalty of our community leaders lie? 

<p> This is our community. Why should we allow the BOP to dictate which land they will destroy. Why can't our leaders stand up to the BOP and demand that the prison be built on Natalie East, the site BVPA has supported all along? If we are to believe that the BOP and our leaders truly want the best for our community, they will preserve Brush Valley and use an alternate site. 

<p> BVPA is proud to fight for our environment, our community and our future. If only our community leaders shared this pride.
