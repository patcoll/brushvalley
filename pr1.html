<p>Sheltered from the public for decades, a 2000-acre portion of Brush
Valley known as Trout Run has been receiving a lot of attention lately.
. and rightfully so.&nbsp; Despite environmental issues and public opposition,
Northumberland County Commissioners want to destroy an important part of
our community's watershed for economic development.&nbsp; However, reckless
development does not render economic growth.
<p>A group of concerned citizens has established the Brush Valley Preservation
Association.&nbsp; We believe that developing and destroying this watershed
is environmentally irresponsible and not in the best interest of our community.&nbsp;
With the support of the PA Chapter of the Sierra Club, we as an association
promise to work to save this land from development.&nbsp; Our mission is
to inform the public on current issues relating to Brush Valley, organize
activities to promote public support, address concerns and opinions of
the community, and actively pursue funding from government agencies and
private foundations to keep Brush Valley in its natural state.
<p>Development is not the only choice for Brush Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
piece of land contains a 35 million gallon lake ("Ice Dam"), natural sand
springs, wooded land, wildlife, and possibly endangered species.&nbsp;
We have already researched funding possibilities to preserve Brush Valley
for the entire community to enjoy as a public park.&nbsp; Grants are available
to acquire this land to use for public recreational activities (e.g., hiking,
fishing, hunting, camping, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous environmental groups,
public agencies, and conservancies have expressed interest in working with
our organization.
<p>We believe that the community as a whole has the right to decide what
is best for our area.&nbsp; The Brush Valley Preservation Association can't
save Brush Valley alone.&nbsp; It is very important to show that we have
public support.&nbsp; If you are interested in getting involved or would
just like more information, please email <a href="mailto:brushvalley@mail.com">brushvalley@mail.com</a> or write
