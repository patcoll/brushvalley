         Vowing to support the preservation and protection of Northumberland County’s Brush Valley, Green Party Candidate for Attorney General Thomas Linzey endorsed the work of the Brush Valley Preservation Association today. 
         <p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association was established to preserve and protect a 2,000 acre portion of Brush Valley in Northumberland County. The acreage hosts a 35 million gallon lake, natural sand springs, and a diverse collection of wildlife. The Association has worked to support the preservation of the land in its natural state for the recreational use and enjoyment of Northumberland County residents. 
         <p>Linzey declared that the work of the Association is “similar to work being done across the Commonwealth to enhance the quality of life of Pennsylvania’s residents through ensuring that our great wildlands are forever protected from reckless and irresponsible development. Local and State government should heed the work done by hundreds of community groups across Pennsylvania to protect our last remaining forests and farmlands. Protection of the health, safety, and welfare of our communities demands that our elected officials work towards these important goals.” 
         <p>As Attorney General, Linzey vows to establish a task force within the Office which will provide grassroots community and environmental organizations with the tools necessary to work towards protection and preservation of wildlands. Linzey explained that “I can think of no higher purpose for the Office of Attorney General than in working closely with community groups to achieve a sustainable vision for Pennsylvania’s future. I hold the Brush Valley Preservation Association forward as a sterling example of what great things Pennsylvanians can accomplish by working together to protect our magnificent natural legacy.” 
         <p>Linzey has also worked on behalf of the Association to ensure that the County and other agencies comply with Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law by releasing documents relevant to the County’s plan to build a new prison in Brush Valley. He cautioned Pennsylvanians about the risk of development authorities which have arisen in increasing numbers across the State, explaining that “the cozy relationship between local government and private corporations must stop. These development authorities, established by local governments to circumvent state financial laws, lack oversight and represent the continued use of public monies for private development purposes. As Attorney General, I pledge to fully investigate the influence that private corporations exert over our democratically elected local governments.” 
         <p>Finally, Linzey excoriated the budget-reckless Northumberland County Commissioners for continuing to pursue an expensive prison construction project in the face of immense County debt. Linzey stated that “unfortunately, the elected Commissioners of Northumberland County have chosen to pursue irresponsible development in the face of an empty bank account.” 
         <p>Linzey, 31, is running on the Green Party slate this year, alongside Ralph Nader as the Party’s presidential nominee, and a full slate of Green Party statewide candidates. The Pennsylvania Green Party placed these candidates onto the State ballot in July, after collecting over 47,000 signatures statewide.
