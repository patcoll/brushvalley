The Coal Township Commissioners came up with a brainstorm of an idea -- to invest in a golf course. But not any golf course. A golf course which will cost $6.1 million, a golf course which is over 1 1/2 hours away and a golf course that is currently bankrupt. They must have taken a crash course in Real Estate 101: How to make a really bad investment while destroying the municipality's credit in the process. By the way, shouldn't they be trying to invest in projects that would improve recreation in OUR area? 

<p> For nearly one year, BVPA has attempted to appeal to these very same individuals to convey the need for recreation and open space in our community. Unfortunately, the Coal Township Commissioners, all proponents of the prison being built in Brush Valley and all possessing the authority to stop such reckless development, have given the public an impression that recreation is senseless and nonprofitable. 

<p> Yet they are willing to jeopardize OUR municipal credit on a failing golf course in York County! Remember, if this project falls through (as most likely it will, considering the facts), our township will only pay more for future bond issues in Coal Township. 

<p> Perhaps they have been taking "get rich quick" lessons from our majority county commissioners. Perhaps they know something about this golf course that the rest of us do not (hidden oil wells?). All I know is that with elections looming over their heads, our Coal Township Commissioners should be more concerned about OUR community's needs. It won't be the golfers in York County to re-elect them, it will be us, the Coal Township citizens. 

<p> Why can't our township commissioners invest in a project that will benefit us, like purchasing Brush Valley for a park? BVPA and its members value the importance of recreation. Ironically, the cost to purchase Brush Valley for open space ($4.7 million) is considerably less than the purchase of this golf course. Hey, commissioners, why not invest in OUR resources to benefit OUR community? Just a thought. See you on election day!
