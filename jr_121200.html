The Growing Greener legislation presented to the residents of Pennsylvania by Gov. Ridge is a positive step in preserving Penn's Woods for our children. The governor has stated that we, the citizens of Pennsylvania, are responsible for protecting our mountains, waters, forests and open spaces. This is such important legislation that our environment is enshrined in our state Constitution. This grants the citizens of our state the right to clean air, pure water, preserving open space and the preservation of our environment. 

<p> So important is this constitutional right that our state government will allot $500 million dollars for preserving open space, provide opportunities for recreation, restore our watersheds and other Growing Greener programs. To put it simply, our governor wants to save our state's open spaces and farmland from irresponsible destruction. 

<p> Then, we have the majority county commissioners of Northumberland County who are virtually thumbing their noses at our governor and his Growing Greener legislation. They are in the process of destroying 2,000 acres. For what? For the construction of a prison/industrial complex and for upscale housing! This is an outright tragedy, especially when there are thousands of acres of other suitable lands available. This land that will be destroyed is in a portion of our watershed. Granted, this part is not used currently for our water supply, but it is a valuable resource to preserve for the future. On this land are natural sand springs with water so pure you can dip a cup into the water and drink. They will be destroyed forever along with the surrounding wetlands that are so environmentally important. This acreage also abounds with wildlife of all sorts and native plants. The plants will be gone forever and the wildlife will most likely die off from a lack of forested land. 

<p> We in the coal region have seen the results of our land having been destroyed by the coal barons of long ago. They made their profits and walked away, leaving this raped land for us. All around us we see dirty coal banks and abandoned stripping pits hundreds of feet deep. But, as we look towards the Glen Burn culm bank that is hundreds of feet high, we know there is a magnificent land of unparalleled beauty over the top and on the other side. This is 2,000 acres of almost virgin forest that will soon be destroyed for no other reason than irresponsible planning and foresight! 

<p> Over 400 members of the Brush Valley Preservation Association ask our governor to step in and stop this needless destruction.
