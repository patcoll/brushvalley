<p>Shamokin RD 1: It is amazing that at a time when conservation-oriented government officials and environmentalists are looking for ways to prevent the loss of forest land, our county's majority commissioners seem determined to destroy one of the most beautiful natural forest areas in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. 

<p>Why should the commissioners support the destruction of the valley in the name of building a prison when there are other alternative locations that could be utilized? The majority commissioners have a history of deceiving the voters of Northumberland County. Hopefully, conservation-minded citizens will join the fight to prevent the loss of Brush Valley and save it for a recreation park which would improve the quality of life for our area citizens and would be an asset in attracting industry to our county. 

<p>Why should our commissioners spend almost $5 million of the people's hard-earned tax dollars to purchase Brush Valley from the water company? If the federal Bureau of Prisons wants to construct a prison in our county, shouldn't they purchase the land directly from the water company? Our county is already almost $44 million in debt with interest and principal. 

<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association would like the Natalie East site to be seriously considered. It seems no one wants to open their eyes and look at the possibility of the bright future that site could create for our area. 

<p>If the prison were to be built on the Natalie East site with the infrastructure in place in that area, thousands of additional acres could be opened up for new industry to come into our county. 

<p>The site is much closer to Interstate 81 than the Brush Valley site. Isn't this what happened in the Hazleton area with Humboldt Park and isn't it presently happening in Schuylkill County in the Mahanoy City and Gordon areas? They are promoting the Keystone Opportunity Zones (KOZ), taking advantage of all the opportunities available in KOZ areas to bring decent-paying jobs to their counties. Why is it that our area appears to only be interested in putting the taxpayers millions and millions of dollars more in debt rather than taking advantage of the opportunities that could open up this county to further development if the prison were to be built at the Natalie East site? 

<p>Before anyone replies that Natalie East is undermined, the Brush Valley Preservation Association contends, after receiving coal investigation maps and speaking with very knowledgeable people, that the Natalie East site could provide several hundred acres of unmined land. Another huge plus for the Natalie East site is the close proximity of the co-gen plant which could supply the power to a prison and other industries as is done in Schuylkill County. 

<p>Instead of a "coal mine," I think we could create a "gold mine" of decent-paying jobs for our people. Isn't this what our majority commissioners should be trying to do rather than getting taxpayers deeper and deeper in debt? 

<p>Doesn't it make sense to promote an area where real growth could occur?
