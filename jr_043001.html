<p>Editor's note: The text of an e-mail exchange between Todd Roup, of Sen. Edward's Helfrick's staff, and Joseph Rebar, of Brush Valley Preservation Association, on the future of Brush Valley was received by The News-Item through two sources. 

<p>Helfrick sent a letter to editor, attached the e-mails, and invited The News-Item to print the e-mails verbatim along with his letter. Rebar sent the e-mails (in slightly condensed form and with some minor language changes) as a letter to the editor from BVPA. 

<p>An introductory paragraph from Rebar stated: "Officers of BVPA met with the senator a few months ago and we had hoped he had a change of heart about destroying Brush Valley, a valuable natural resource. His note [here Rebar is referring to the first paragraph of Roup's e-mail] confirms that he has not changed his mind. He condones the environmental destruction of Brush Valley:. 

<p>The e-mails, as provided by Helfrick, are as follows: 

<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE: From Todd Roup (Helfrick's aide) to Brush Valley Preservation Association officers on April 25: 

<p>"Nicole (Dormer) and John (Faraguna): Senator Helfrick and I spent some time talking about Brush Valley this week. He's not prepared to back away from his original position -- support the prison and work to preserve the remaining portion of the valley for conservation efforts. He will continue to oppose the commissioners' plan to develop the remainder of the valley for residential and light industrial development. 

<p>"We are also concerned about a news article where a member claimed a commitment from the Game Commission to purchase a portion of the valley for $400 per acre. We know where the figure comes from -- they are limited by statute to that price -- but we are not aware of any formal commitment from PGC. We would appreciate a clarification." 

<p>REPLY: From Joseph Rebar of BVPA to Roup on April 26: 

<p>"Hi Todd. The member you are referring to is me, Joseph Rebar. And, I'm not offended if you'd name me other than saying "a member." I was misquoted in that article on two items. The mention of the possible funding by DCNR in a letter to BVPA through Rep. Phillips. You'll see the correction to that point in today's edition of The News-Item on page 2. In reference to the $400 from the PGC, I did say, 'The Game Commission could 'possibly' provide up to $400 per acre if they were so inclined.' I did not say that the 'PGC would provide $400 per acre.' Clarification: Provided. 

<p>"The Brush Valley Preservation Association will not agree to or support any project within Brush Valley that includes ANY construction or wanton destruction of that valley. We DO NOT support the partial destruction and/or the partial saving of the land. Our position is: No destruction whatsoever of any portion of the 2,000 acres comprising the land known as Brush Valley. That valley is to be preserved in its natural state. Environmental destruction of the valley is not an option. Period! Brush Valley is a valuable natural resource that must be preserved. Period! Clarification: Provided! 

<p>"Senator Helfrick is well aware of the value of this land as a natural resource and he, of all people, a sportsman and elected official, should understand that destroying this resource IS NOT AN OPTION. It's time for the senator to take a stand in this issue instead of dodging the issue with his idea of a prison on a part of the land and recreation on the remaining land. The senator's thoughts border on the ludicrous and that's putting it mildly! 

<p>"Our governor has offered up to $650 million to preserve our natural resources and preserve Penn's Woods. If the senator isn't up to speed on that, it's the "Growing Greener" program. Where does the senator stand on this plan? It certainly appears that the senator wants Brush Valley, a valuable natural resource, destroyed. In my humble opinion, the senator is just not making much logical sense, is he? An answer to that question would be interesting, if not "dodged." 

<p>"We feel the senator should take a strong public stand with preserving Brush Valley in its natural state and for the location of the federal prison on environmentally friendly land at Natalie. The residents of eastern Northumberland County deserve to have a family recreation area. Our land has been raped by the coal barons of long ago and left in disarray. Brush Valley is the ONLY land within 40 miles of Shamokin that could provide family recreation. The senator preaches family values in many issues. Why not this issue? Clarification, please! 

<p>"It's time the senator stands tall (and takes a stand) in support of preserving Brush Valley in its natural state, helping to get funding to preserve Brush Valley as a family recreation area, support the plan of the Brush Valley Preservation Association: a prison at Brush Valley and family recreation in Brush Valley. 

<p>"Senator Helfrick, it's time to stop dodging on the issues at hand and take a stand!"
