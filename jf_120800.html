Recently, the Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) has been researching the many aspects of the proposed destruction of Brush Valley. We have uncovered some interesting facts and would like to take this opportunity to pass along some of our findings and opinions. 

<p> We would like to address the role of Philadelphia Suburban Corporation, the owner of the Roaring Creek Division (offices in Shamokin) in this matter. Some people seem to believe that because Brush Valley is privately owned, it should be of no concern to anyone what the water company does with its property. However, it should be remembered just how much you, the taxpayer, will be asked to contribute to this proposal. Your contribution will be about $7 million dollars of your county tax money plus whatever the federal government spends on a prison (upwards of $120 million). Spending our tax dollars certainly entitles us to have a say about this proposal. 

<p> And what a sweet deal it is for Philadelphia Suburban of Philadelphia. They and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company have tried unsuccessfully to sell this land for years. So, they offered it to the Northumberland County commissioners (or us, the taxpayers!) for an incredible $4.8 million. Of this 1,937 acres, only about 800 acres are usable for any construction, and they most likely will have problems due to wetland and other environmental concerns. 

<p> Also, the water company will retain all rights to any water in or under the valley, and any business sited in Brush Valley will be made to purchase water from Philadelphia Suburban Water exclusively. This information was found in some of the records BVPA forced the county to disclose. 

<p> It's very obvious that the water company will profit greatly from this deal. That's fine, but why are we, the taxpayers, being forced to spend our incomes to subsidize their profits? 

<p> Philadelphia Suburban Water is so concerned about this plan proceeding that they have undertaken what we believe amounts to scare tactics aimed at the community. A recent news release from the Roaring Creek Division vice president states that if a prison is built in Brush Valley, it will have a stabilizing effect on water rates. We read that as saying if a prison is not built here prepare for our water rates to go up, AGAIN! BVPA has contacted the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and learned that our rates are already high in relation to other Pennsylvania communities. Not getting an anticipated windfall through the sale of this land is not grounds to raise our rates. 

<p> BVPA has made many unsuccessful attempts to contact Nick DeBenedictis, CEO of Roaring Creek's parent company, Philadelphia Suburban, located near Philadelphia. It really does not surprise us that he is not interested in preserving Brush Valley since we understand that he was a strong supporter of the proposed, but defeated, toxic waste incinerator in Union County. We were contacted by a local subordinate of Mr. DeBenedictis who basically stated that even if the county does not purchase Brush Valley, they still would not be interested in seeing it used for recreation for our residents. Environmentalists they are not, but we think they should be more concerned about the welfare of the community to which they owe their existence. 

<p> In another related matter, members of BVPA recently attended a meeting of the Shamokin-Coal Township Sewer Authority. When asked if the sewer board would offer any special rates or discounted services to the federal Bureau of Prisons for a new prison, the members would not say one way or another. This may be another example of how you (everyone who pays sewer fees), are paying for the benefit of the few. This should be of particular concern to the people in the Sunnyside-Overlook area who are being forced to hook on to the sewer system at excessively high rates while the Bureau of Prisons might get reduced hookup fees and user rates. 

<p> In regards to the "few" who may benefit from a prison in Brush Valley, we acutely realize the need for employment in our area. Our local development groups and politicians have done little or nothing to alleviate our economic woes. 

<p> This is why BVPA still encourages a prison be built in this area, but on the best, not least suitable site. That being said, it must be remembered that the proposed Brush Valley prison project would affect the ENTIRE taxpayer population of Northumberland County, so the good of the entire population must be considered. To the person who called the newspaper and asked if I could get him a job if the prison is not built, I have to ask, will you get everyone else another Brush Valley if it is? 

<p> The loss of Brush Valley would be a tragedy for our community environmentally, economically and socially. BVPA is therefore publicly extending an invitation to representatives of Northumberland County, Philadelphia Suburban Corp. (the water company), local community leaders and other involved groups to discuss not just Brush Valley, but all other issues affecting our area. We are a growing group of 400 well-informed, concerned, and voting taxpayers. We believe our opinions and ideas should be heard, especially our opinion that the needs of EVERYONE need to be addressed.
