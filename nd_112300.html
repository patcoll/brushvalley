Shamokin: As vice president of the Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA), I would like to first extend my deepest gratitude to Clyde Peeling for speaking to our group and educating us on the challenges he faced in his community. It's very easy to see a toxic incinerator as a dangerous entity, polluting communities and endangering lives. Mr. Peeling spoke very passionately about his fight for he believes strongly in preserving the integrity of our environment. But his lesson to BVPA was not about toxic incinerators but instead about taking responsibility for our environment and making sound judgments. It would be moronic to compare a prison to an incinerator, but you CAN compare the decision-making used in both instances; in fact, they mirror themselves. Both projects propose economic growth with little regard for the environment or future planning. 

<p>BVPA strongly opposes the use of Brush Valley for development because the land is more valuable in its natural state than developed. In order to seek businesses and industry, first we must make this a desirable place to live. Natural space improves the quality of life and contributes to economic development, high quality jobs, increased property value, etc. It's simple to say a prison will create jobs. But ask yourself, how many will truly benefit and will it benefit you? A prison is not an answer to our economic problems. We need a plan. 

<p>Where are our leaders? Do they actually think that simply plopping a prison into our natural space will cure our economic woes? Do they honestly think that the prison will bring other industries into this area? Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Prisons do not create sustainable communities. The community must have an economic backbone to stand on first. Ours doesn't. 

<p>BVPA urges our leaders to establish a comprehensive plan that will enable our community to establish growth boundaries, manage blight, revitalize downtowns, encourage responsible development and maintain natural space. Across the state, Gov. Ridge has established the Growing Smarter initiative "to identify and promote the use of the best land management practices." A prison will provide some jobs but without a comprehensive plan, this area will continue to decline. I suggest our leaders obtain a copy of "Land Use in Pennsylvania: Practices and Tools" and learn how to improve our community responsibly. 

<p>Up until now, those responsible for promoting our area have done very little. Instead, they have allowed our community to become a wasteland where businesses neither prosper nor stay for long. The Brush Valley Chamber of Commerce, while not missing an opportunity to congratulate itself for imaginary achievement, has been impotent in regards to promoting our area and sustaining industry. 

<p>The Chamber of Commerce and county officials support a prison in Northumberland County. BVPA supports a prison as well. However, the difference is the Chamber and county wants the prison at any cost; BVPA does not believe losing Brush Valley is either an acceptable or even necessary price to pay. In fact, volunteers of BVPA have worked harder to develop proposals and research alternate sites than those officials paid by the Chamber or the county. Our members believe in improving the community and have dedicated their own time and money to make a difference. 

<p>Finally, I would like to assure the public that BVPA does not plan to harass and intimidate individuals or intrude on their private lives. We DO, however, plan to reinforce our beliefs and ensure that those making the decisions for us are held accountable for their actions. Please remember, despite Brush Valley being privately owned, both county and federal monies will be used to buy that land and build that prison. You do have a say!
