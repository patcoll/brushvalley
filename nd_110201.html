The Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) was very pleased by comments made by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Department of Conservation & Natural Resources (DCNR) in a recent <a href="depdcnr.html">letter</a> to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) in which they stated, "in light of the potential for environmental impacts on the Coal Township site (Brush Valley), further consideration should be given to alternative sites that are listed in the DEIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement)", since the site possesses "valuable water resources, exceptional value wetlands and mature, diverse forested lands." BVPA views the agencys' letter as a monumental victory since DEP & DCNR are expressing the views that BVPA has expounded all along . . .preserve Brush Valley and build on Natalie East.

<p>Unfortunately, editorials in local newspapers have cast blame on the BVPA by suggesting our organization has been trying to stop the development of a prison in Northumberland County. BVPA wants to assert, that if for any reason, the prison does not come to Northumberland County, it is not BVPA's fault, but the fault of the politicians that attempted to force the prison into Brush Valley!   First of all, BVPA formed soley to stop any type of development in Brush Valley, that was and continues to be our goal! We have said all along that we support the location of a prison in Northumberland County, just not in Brush Valley! We even conducted tireless research to find a feasible site (Natalie East) which provides a viable alternative for the development of a prison. Secondly, the purpose of the DEIS process is to solicit comments and questions regarding the proposed project. BVPA submitted over 200 comments alone.  Representatives of DEP and  DCNR are simply doing their jobs by presenting their concerns regarding the development of Brush Valley. Congressman Kanjorski is casting blame and annoyance with the agency's involvement.  I find his reactions not only inappropriate but extremely arrogant. After all, what qualifications does Kanjorski have that he can assure the public that no diverse environmental effects will occur as a result of building a prison in Brush Valley?  Why should we have complete faith in the FBOP to determine which site is most suitable? BVPA has reviewed and analyzed the DEIS. . the document contained numerous errors and excluded important information.  Kanjorski, along with Sen. Helfrick and Rep. Belfanti, are crtiizing DEP & DCNR for excercising their responsibility . providing the FBOP with an unbiased view of the proposed project using qualified expertise.  This type of reaction is very unsettling to the BVPA. Shouldn't Kanjorski be happy that there is a system in place that provides checks & balances and does not rely solely on the opinion of one agency to make a decision?. . Isn't that how our system works? DEP and DCNR are simply following the guidelines of Growing Greener and Growing Smarter initiatives that were put forth by the former Governor, Tom Ridge. It is these agencys' duty and responsibility to concern themselves with projects that might avertly detract from these objectives. In addition, DEP has established an impressive land recycling program which enables industrial sites to be reused.  Natalie East for all intents and purposes is a brownfield site and could be remediated to build a prison or house other industry.  

<p>It is important to note that the land within Brush Valley is zoned  conservation.  A recent press release from Helfric/Belfanti/Kanjorski suggested that this privately owned land could be used for projects that may be deemed less desirable by environmentalists and the public. Of course, this is untrue. . the buyer or seller of this land proposing any type of construction project would have to proceed through zoning board hearings. .it is not that simple to build in a watershed, as the FBOP is finding out.  These "threats" seem nothing more than scare tactics devised by the proponents of the prison to suggest that if the prison isn't built in Brush Valley some other horrible entity will come. . . so we should settle for the less of two evils.   
 
<p>Recent events have given BVPA new optimism on our struggle to save Brush Valley.  State agencies have come out and stressed their concern for building in Brush Valley; numerous citizens were present at the FBOP meeting to voice their disapproval of the site; BVPA has received encouraging information that supports the alternate site, Natalie East. 
Yet, the proponents of the prison, from politicians to the local newspapers, have insisted that this prison be built in Brush Valley.  Why?  If a prison is so sorely needed in this area and the benefits of this project would stand to help so many, why do the prison proponents insist that the prison be built in Brush Valley? If BVPA were to announce tomorrow that evidence exists to support the building of a prison on Natalie East, would these individuals still insist that it be built in Brush Valley?  Would they destroy a prime watershed, wetlands and woodlands even if it could be spared by using an alternate site?  Kanjorski is wrong, it does not have to be "Brush Valley or nothing".

<p>I suggest to Congressman Kanjorski, Rep. Belfanti, Sen. Helfrick & the majority commissioners of Northumberland County to support the placement of a prison on Natalie East and preserve Brush Valley as a recreational area.  BVPA has established goals that will enable all parties involved to win. We can have a prison and preserve Brush Valley. It is time for prison proponents  to put pride and political differences aside and join BVPA in completing these goals.  We can all work together.
