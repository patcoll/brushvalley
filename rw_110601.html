It seems as though you are chastising the BVPA in a recent editorial for notifying DEP and DCNR of the proposed destruction of a vast amount of nature and natural resources in Brush Valley in return for a very minimal number of jobs in the building of a federal prison there. 
<p>
I personally interpret the editorial to mean BVPA blew the whistle on those who are in favor of building the prison in Brush Valley. I also interpret the editorial to infer that those in favor of the prison being built in Brush Valley had it made and destroying nature and natural resources was the right thing to do in order to get a handful of jobs in the area -- that is, until BVPA came along and opened their big mouths to state environmental authorities.. 
<p>
You make it sound like if BVPA had not sought the help of DEP and DCNR in their effort to preserve "exceptional" natural resources, we -- those in favor of building a federal prison in Brush Valley -- would have been home free. Now that BVPA got two state environmental agencies involved in their effort to save Brush Valley, they will be the ones to blame if a federal prison is not built anywhere in Northumberland County. How ludicrous! 
<p>
BVPA has and always will promote the building of a federal prison on very suitable alternate sites, if the BOP and county government refuse to exploit the numerous other alternatives. It is they and not BVPA who bullheadedly chose not to build a federal prison in Northumberland County. 
<p>
Perhaps the county politicians view Brush Valley as just another piece of idle land to be raped and destroyed in a lame effort to provide jobs to "select" citizens in the Shamokin area in order to keep the minimal support of their hard core followers. In reality, the majority of the citizens, most of whom don't even know what a devastating impact the destruction of natural resources will have on future generations, remain silent and neutral on the subject, taking the "it doesn't affect me" attitude. Well, it will eventually affect all citizens of Northumberland County in one way or another. Only then it will be too late to correct a major mistake made by our long-gone elected officials. 
<p>
Since BVPA is being fingered as the culprit that contacted DEP and DCNR, in other words, a whistle blower, I say that state governmental agencies such as DEP and DCNR were created to do exactly what they are doing in the Brush Valley controversy. I feel that not only BVPA but every citizen has not only the right but indeed the moral obligation to inform state environmental agencies of any proposed criminal acts against nature. So tell me, Mr. Editor, where do your moral obligations lie concerning the wanton destruction of nature and natural resources? 
<p>
Mr. Cwalina made a statement to the effect that DEP and DCNR are only two of 50 state agencies that have a say in the matter concerning the building of a prison in Brush Valley. Tell me, Mr. Cwalina, who are the other 48 state environmental agencies being paid for with my tax dollars to protect our environment? If, in fact, there are 48 other state environmental agencies that were created to protect and preserve nature and natural resources, then the government of the state of Pennsylvania must have felt that not only are nature and natural resources in peril, but it must be imperative to prevent any further destruction of what the state has left. Therefore, please tell me, Mr. Cwalina, who are the other 48 state environmental agencies that I may contact them and inform them also of the proposed criminal destruction of our environment in Brush Valley. Maybe they can get together as a team with DEP and DCNR to help save this majestic forest from irresponsible destruction. 
<p>
If the BOP is, in fact, scared off and decides not to build anywhere in Northumberland County -- even though other sites are available -- because they could not get their way, then I say so be it. BOP can act like a spoiled child who cannot get his way and take their ball and bat and go home. Should this happen, I will not feel ashamed or embarrassed as a member of BVPA for that decision. Instead, I will feel extremely proud of the fact that I was instrumental in the preservation of exceptional forest, wetlands, natural resources and overall natural habitat. That said, what have you done lately, Mr. Editor, to help protect and preserve our environment for future generations?
