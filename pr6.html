The Brush Valley Preservation Association would like to reply
to some of the vague and misleading information that has recently been
released by the supporters of developing Brush Valley.
<p>
First, it is wrong to assume that a prison in Brush Valley is a
"done deal". All that has happened is the Bureau of Prisons has made
official what we, and everyone else, have known for months.  Brush
Valley is and has always been their primary target. Nothing has really
changed, including the chances of stopping this project.  In fact, the
environmental studies phase that is now beginning is the most likely
time for the prison to be halted,  just as it was at Moosic Mountain
near Scranton.
<p>
Secondly, we would like to stress again that we are not opposed to
a prison elsewhere in our county.  B.V.P.A. is acutely aware of the need
for economic progress in Northumberland County.  Most of our members ,
including myself, are not retired, and must deal everyday with the
depressed conditions of our area.  We strongly feel, however, that the possible gains brought by a prison
are far outweighed by the lose of Brush Valley, and we feel just as
strongly that the prison should be built on one of the alternate sites
available.
<p>
Regarding alternate sites, the two we submitted were quickly
dismissed by the county for reasons we think flawed.  For example, the
county engineers claim that the site we researched East of Natalie is
land locked and undermined. However, we have documentation taken from
county deeds and state mining maps indicating that the same company that
owns the site, Consumers of Pa, actually owns land connecting the site
to Rt. 54.
<p>
Also, the Bureau of Mine Reclamation maps show NO problems listed for
the site.  There is even adjoining land owned by the water company that
could be used to expand the site for perimeter and non-structural use.
<p>
The Natalie East site, as well as the Boyers Nob site should be
seriously considered.  We feel they are very suitable for prison
construction. We have, however,been told that the County has done no
written report on the sites, and we have no knowledge the the B.O.P., or
any other party we submitted the information to, has checked into them
at all  
<p>
It has also been said that if the B.O.P. doesn't come to Brush
Valley the water company will ultimately sell it for some other
development.  But will this really happen?  In a Jan. 18th News Item
article the executive vice president and  general manager of Consumers
water company stated that, and I'm quoting from the article," the cost
of developing some 2000 acres of unspoiled woodlands would be
tremendous-more than most firms would be willing to expend. That is why
the county was the natural choice for the project". 
<p>
It must also be pointed out that any environmental laws and
regulations that would prevent the building of a prison in Brush Valley
would also block any private or corporate development. This being so, we
at B.V.P.A. believe it is in the water companies best interest to
consider selling the land for conservation and public recreational use.
We have already found large amounts of government and private funding to
do so.
<p>
Lastly, what are the real economic gains of a prison? A recent
article by the majority commissioners compared them with the benefits
brought by the state prison in Coal Township. A closer look reveals that
two of the largest contracts noted by the commissioners, the waste
hauling and food purchasing contracts are not valid. Also remember that the 1.1 million dollars quoted in the
article are gross revenues, not net.  That doesn't leave much to trickle
down to the local economy. Couple this to the fact all contracts must go out on bid and you see that the economic argument is
weak at best. As proof of this I offer statistics taken from the Pa.
dept of Labor and Industry.  Between 1990 and 1995, the years including
construction and opening of the CoalTwp. prison, Northumberland Co.'s
ranking in the state for average yearly wage DECLINED ten places.  This
proves without a doubt that the alleged economic benefits don't exist.  
<p>
Actual affects of a Federal prison may be even less helpful to our
area since they use products made within the prison systems at their
Unicor factories.  Such things as furniture, printed forms, certain
clothing , and may other goods and services will never  go out on bid
because they will be provided by the inmates themselves.
<p>
There are many other issues that could be addressed in this article,
but there is not nearly enough time or space available. For more

Please plan to attend the BOP  meeting the 31st.  It's your chance
to express YOUR opinions.
