<p>For quite some time now the Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) has been releasing information showing that we have indeed found the funding that could be used to preserve Brush Valley for a public nature park. Several land trust conservancies we have contacted have shown great interest in helping to purchase and preserve Brush Valley. Also, state agencies such as the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) have said they could offer funding and technical help for such a project. Contrary to the uninformed claims made by the Northumberland Planning Commission, we have a statement from DCNR saying as much. Other groups such as sportsman organizations and private citizens have said they would be willing to help to preserve Brush Valley. Indeed, the great number of funding and assistance sources that are available prove that a "Brush Valley Park" is truly possible. 

<p>When the BVPA has contacted the above-mentioned people and groups and told them about this situation, they almost always ask how our local political figures feel about the possibility of using Brush Valley for public recreation. BVPA already knew that most of our officials were in favor of destroying Brush Valley for the purpose of building another prison, allegedly for jobs. Knowing this, BVPA has decided to ask some of our local officials a simple question: If, for any reason, it is decided that a prison will not be built in Brush Valley, would you then support the attempt to preserve Brush Valley and open it to the public? 

<p>This would seem to be a "no-brainer" as it does not ask them to choose between a prison or park but simply asks if they would support what would be a fantastic opportunity for our area on land that may be otherwise wasted. Sadly, the lack of enthusiasm shown by many of these people is confusing and disheartening. Much of the response has ranged from the same "can't do" attitude we have experienced before to a genuine lack of interest for our community's quality of life. BVPA does understand some of the respondents' concern for jobs, but to not care about saving Brush Valley, even if no prison were to be built there, is reprehensible. Anyone who would not want our people to enjoy Brush Valley, if it becomes possible, certainly does not have the best interests of our community in mind, and they definitely should not ever be elected again to represent us. 

<p>Most of the people we contacted seemed little inclined to say they would like to see Brush Valley preserved if a prison is not built there. Only Representative Phillips, who has our greatest respect, has said in no uncertain terms that every option should be explored for a prison site and that Brush Valley should be saved. He believes, as does BVPA, that Northumberland County can have the best of both worlds, with a prison built in an environmentally sound location and the valley purchased for public recreation. 

<p>The majority county commissioners, as well as the Coal Township commissioners were quite reluctant to agree with saving Brush Valley, even if it were not chosen for a prison site. It took much prodding, constantly reiterating that "IF" no prison was built, and "IF" the water company agreed to sell, for them to grudgingly agree that this plan should be explored. Clearly, the quality of life in our area and the environment are not priorities for them. 

<p>In a conversation I recently had with Representative Belfanti he stated basically that he would like as many prisons as possible in Brush Valley, and again only after lengthy explanation did he say that if it was not used for a prison he would support trying to have it preserved. Mr. Belfanti seemed genuinely concerned about the jobs prisons might create. BVPA shares these concerns, but wishes Mr. Belfanti would consider all our citizens' well-being, not just potential prison employees. 

<p>Most disappointing of all is the stance taken by Senator Helfrick. As chairman of the Game and Fisheries Committee, we truly believed he would be in full support of the BVPA's efforts. After all, as a self-proclaimed sportsman and a resident of our area, he must be aware of the dwindling amount of land available to the average person for the pursuit of outdoor recreation. Sadly, he has chosen to be in favor of a prison in Brush Valley with whatever is left over preserved. How can a true outdoorsman ever support the destruction of any of this beautiful valley? 

<p>Other than Mr. Phillips the only other officeholder who seems to be making environmentally and socially responsible decisions is Minority County Commissioner Sam Dietrick. He believes that Brush Valley should actively be pursued for recreation if no prison is built there. 

<p>The other major player in this issue is the owners of Brush Valley, Philadelphia Suburban Water Company. I have personally left a message for Nick DeBenedictis, and if he calls I will do my best to impress on him the need to preserve Brush Valley. The local branch of this company owes its very existence to our residents, their customers, yet would rather see the valley used for anything other than our enjoyment. Yes, it's their land and they can decide how it is used, but BVPA's 800 members, as well as others, are not comfortable with our tax dollars (both county and federal) being used to destroy it. At this time the water company has no incentive to sell Brush Valley for a park, but if the prison project and the county plan are stopped, they may be more likely to consider it. They have, after all, been trying to sell it for years, and the opportunity to sell the entire valley for recreation, with its associated tax reduction, may be quite attractive to them. 

<p>Inevitably, the Brush Valley issue has become, and will remain, mixed with politics and economics. We should remember, however, that this is about preserving nature. BVPA did not form to find a site for a prison, nor are we a chamber of commerce working on our economic picture. We are not scapegoats to be blamed if a prison is not built here. That would be on the hands of people whose responsibility it is to have actual plans in place, but really don't. BVPA is simply a group of people who know the value of nature, and that no dollar amount can be placed on it. We are concerned about our entire community, not just what benefits us individually. Right or wrong, we believe in people's rights to speak their minds and have a say in things that affect them. BVPA is democracy at its best, and no matter what happens to Brush Valley, I will always be proud to have been associated with such thoughtful people.
