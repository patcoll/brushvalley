February 1, 2001<p>
 
Monday night I read with great interest and much sadness the Chamber article describing how Stecker's office supply store is closing after 125 years of doing business in our area. What makes this closing particularly sad, however, is the realization that they are just one of many companies in the Shamokin-Mount Carmel area that have recently, or will shortly, be gone forever, even while the rest of the country has been enjoying the strongest economy in history. 

<p>Anyone familiar with our community certainly has to admit, whether they want to or not, that is unfortunately true. But what can we attribute this continuing decline to? We can't blame it on any deficiency in our work force. Our people have education and training options nearby and our work ethic is second to none. The argument about not having adequate roadways is also flawed since we had at one time much industry in this area with the same roads. We have plenty of available resources and land, as well as people with professional attitudes. 

<p>For some reason, however, our residents are increasingly being segregated into one of two categories -- retirees, or commuters. Interestingly enough, this downturn mirrors the spurt in prison construction in our area. With one private, three state, and six federal correction facilities within commuter range, we are now the "ground zero" of prisons. If the pro-prison propaganda is to be believed, we should be more prosperous than most areas. Sadly for us, the reality is quite opposite. 

<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association has in fact been accumulating research information that indicates that prisons may actually drive industry and population away, while at the same time lowering property values and increasing taxpayer burden for increased public services. This assertion could certainly be argued over, but as evidence to prove this theory I suggest people just walk through our downtown areas. Think about all the businesses, stores, and restaurants that were part of our community for so long but are now gone forever. Think about the people who have moved away in order to make a living. Think about the pride this area once had as a industrial and cultural center. Now think about our leaders practically begging for another prison, promising anything, including destroying Brush Valley, to get one. 

<p>As for local merchants like Stecker's, remember that prisons must go with the lowest bid when purchasing supplies or services and small local firms find it hard to compete. Also, the very products Stecker's sells, office furniture and stationery, are made by the federal prisons' own factories, thereby eliminating any chance of those supplies ever even going out on bid. The benefits of prisons to local businesses are small indeed. 

<p>A new prison, if sited in the proper place, and if not forcibly subsidized by our residents, would be welcomed and supported by BVPA. Of course, it surely would not cure our economic and social woes. 

<p>In the worst case scenario, Brush Valley will be lost, our county will slip further into debt, and Stecker's will join a growing list of blank, vacant store fronts.
