A recent article in our local newspaper has proven once and for all that the Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) is correct in its assertion that there is grant money available to reclaim mine land for the purpose of industrial use. The Brush Valley Chamber of Commerce, with its tired claims that we must "prepare our green fields" (read that Brush Valley) is simply wrong. 

<p> The article details how CAN DO, an industrial development group in the Hazleton area, has just received a $709,000 grant to prepare abandoned mine land for the specific purpose of siting industry. Our chamber has continually stated that our only option is to develop green fields, while BVPA has known for some time about the moneys available for reclamation and development. 

<p> Whether this misinformation by the Chamber was accidental or otherwise we are not sure, but BVPA would be happy to share our data with the Chamber to help them get up to speed. 

<p> Information contained in documents obtained from the county reinforces BVPA's belief that the majority commissioners' plans and tactics are flawed and misleading as well. Although BVPA will be releasing much more data after it can be deciphered, there are a few interesting issues that we think the public would like to know now. 

<p> Area prisons (both the existing state and proposed federal) have been touted by their proponents as beneficial to the entire community. We have, however, discovered that the commissioners have concealed some of their costs. In records, many of which (were) kept hidden from the county controller, we have learned that among other things, the Northumberland County General Authority (the county agency responsible for the SCI Coal Township) is paying $300 a month for 10 years for the sewage tapping fee for the state pen. When asked in a phone conversation how much the federal prison hopes to pay for their sewer hook up, Site Selection Chief for the Bureau of Prisons David Dorworth answered, "Nothing, I hope." How does this benefit the retired people on fixed incomes in the Overlook area who will be forced to hook on to the same sewage system for approximately $1,200? 

<p> Also, the Authority (read that taxpayer) paid Coal Township $30,000 for road maintenance, while the rest of us get snowed in. And while many in our area struggle just to feed our families, the Authority threw themselves three Christmas parties, to the tune of nearly $4,000! 

<p> Perhaps even more troubling is the amount that the Authority spends on legal services. In 1997 the Authority spent $21,810, of which $12,600 went to their two solicitors just for retainer fees. How many of us could run a business if over half of our expenses went to pay lawyers? Remember also that if these solicitors actually do anything, they are paid even more! 

<p> In the near future BVPA hopes to release the rest of the related data, including the outrageous cost to the taxpayers associated with the bonds that financed the state prison. 

<p> We believe that if the County, now under the guise of the Northumberland County Development Corporation, is allowed to proceed with their plans to destroy Brush Valley, we can expect much more of the same deficit spending and mismanagement, in addition to the sin of losing that beautiful valley.
