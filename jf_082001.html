My name is John R. Faraguna and I am president of the Brush Valley Preservation Association.  Thank you for coming out today.  The BVPA was formed a year and a half ago for the purpose of preserving the trout run area, better known as Brush Valley. We are growing in number with aprx. 1,000 members and have the approval of numerous governmental agencies, political figures, and nature conservancies. We feel we represent the best interest of our area, our environment, and our people, and we will continue to so.
<p>
I would like to take a few moments to clarify some recent developments concerning Brush Valley.  
<p>
First, the press release last week stating that the prison project in brush valley is a "done deal" is at the very least an exaggeration.  In fact in a news article in the Press Enterprise on Saturday, Bureau of Prisons Site selection Department employee Mark McEvoy is quoted as saying," Whoever made the statement that we (the BOP) are coming there (Brush Valley) for sure, that's an incorrect statement".   It appears that the proponent of destroying Brush Valley, particularly Commissioners Cwalina and Lewis, and Representative Kanjorski, don't want the public to know that there is a long and detailed process ahead, including town meetings and citizen input, before anything is officially decided. 
<p>
Another question that needs to be addressed is why the pro- Brush Valley destruction forces are still using the old scare tactics of "Brush Valley or nowhere" in their propaganda. Perhaps they fear people may learn the truth, that at least one alternate site, Natalie East, IS suitable for a prison. BVPA has had information proving this for some time now, but it has been ignored or trivialized by those in power.   
<p>
Why then won't the landowner, water company Philadelphia Suburban, (who also owns the alternate site), the bop, and certain political figures consider the Natalie site? Not only have we proven that there is enough un-mined land there for a prison, but we have also found examples of the Bop building on land that was mined. It now seems the answer may be something that BVPA has claimed for some time, that there are plans for constructing as may as four new prisons in Brush Valley, completely covering the valley floor. This would of course mean even more water sales for Philly Sub, good for their bottom line, disastrous for Brush Valley.  Paul Kanjorski pretty much confirmed this when he said in a press release that the new prison would take aprx. 200 acres, belted by another 600 acres.  He went on to say that further expansion would probably follow with one or two more prisons and some unspecified private industry. Brush Valley would literally become a valley of asphalt, razor wire, and concrete. This is indeed a sickening scenario, and it is hard to imagine that people of supposed intelligence can back this reckless misuse of nature when other options are available. A few weeks ago, when BVPA stated that this project would destroy the entire valley Cwalina and Lewis called us liars. I believe they now owe us an apology. 
<p>
It is fitting that we are here today in the shadow of two symbols. The first, the Cameron coal bank, representing the mistakes of the past, a time when decisions were made without any regard for nature.  A time when a few self-serving people could use exaggerations and lies to further their own goals. A time when the mere possibility of new jobs, even for only a limited few, excused any burden imposed on the many.
<p>
The second symbol, Brush Valley, stands for all that our area can be. We CAN respect and preserve nature. We CAN improve the quality of life for our people. We CAN have industry, including prisons, to provide needed employment. All we need is to use common sense, logic, and planning in a way that takes into account what is in the best interest of all the people of this community, now and in the future. Instead of coal banks, acid steams, and prisons, Brush Valley could be the NEW symbol for our community.    
One we can be proud of.    
<p>
The BVPA wants the public to know that now that the Bop's environmental studies are being released, we can now finally begin our legal challenges based on environmental grounds.   BVPA is fortunate to be represented legally by the PA Environmental Defense Foundation.  To elaborate further on these challenges, please welcome Ron Evans, the Chairman of the PA Environmental Defense Foundation!
