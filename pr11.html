<p>As the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) continues its study of Brush Valley to
determine the economic and environmental impact of a federal prison on
the area, the BOP is faced with another obstacle. . .an archeological
dig.
  
<p>The Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission (PHMC) is requiring the
BOP to complete a Phase I archeological study which would examine the
project area for possible artifacts.

<p>Rep. Merle Phillips recently sent a letter to PHMC suggesting the agency
take a closer look at the proposed Brush Valley site due to its close
proximity to Shamokin Creek.  In the letter, Mr. Phillips discussed his
concerns that American Indian artifacts may be present in the propose
site.   Mr. Phillips has been working very cooperatively with BVPA to
preserve Brush Valley and focus on alternate sites for development.
These efforts were rewarded when PHMC informed the BOP that "there is a
high probability that significant archaeological sites are located in
this project area [Brush Valley] and could be adversely affected by
project activities".

<p>According to PHMC, Brush Valley is "similar to the settings of known
archealogical sites in the vicinity", warranting a Phase I study.  

<p>The initial study will look for any signs of past human activity
anywhere from prehistoric to colonial eras.  If PHMC discovers any
worthy articles, a more intense study will be implemented, ultimately
resulting in the excavation of the site.  

<p>BVPA believes Brush Valley should remain in its natural state to
preserve the integrity of the community's natural and historical
resources and to ensure that any possible artifacts are protected.
