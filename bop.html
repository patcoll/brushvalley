<p>The Burean of Prisons does not like public
opposition especially since it makes their job harder. The
Bureau of Prisons is required to submit an Environmental Impact Statement
(E.I.S) for each project.  Currently, the BOP is studying <a href="900acres.html">900 acres</a> within Brush Valley. If the public has concerns or questions
regarding the proposed project, and these concerns or questions are presented
in a written form, the B.O.P. must address each concern in the E.I.S.
These letters are very critical for saving Brush Valley. The E.I.S.
is very often a very general assessment completed by an environmental consultant
<b>hired by the B.O.P</b>. If the E.I.S. is not challenged,
the B.O.P. can build its prison. BVPA urges concerned residents to
write to the B.O.P. and voice your concerns regarding the construction
of a prison in Brush Valley.  Brush Valley. . .park or prison, you decide!
<p>Key issues that you may want to include
in your letter:
<ul>
<li>
Pollution of our community's watershed</li>

<li>
Loss of precious wildlife</li>

<li>
Point &amp; Nonpoint Source Pollution</li>

<li>
Increase capacity of our municipality's stormwater
&amp; sewage facilities</li>

<li>
Loss of wetlands could cause erosion</li>
</ul>
Remember every letter counts. It
may only cost you the price of a stamp to save Brush Valley.
