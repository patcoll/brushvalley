<p>In a June 14 letter to the editor, the Northumberland County majority commissioners, in an attempt to deflect and deny the implications of information earlier released by the Brush Valley Preservation Association, stated that I, John R. Faraguna, was a liar. This is indeed a strong statement, especially coming from two people with such a major credibility problem as Mr. Cwalina and Mr. Lewis. I will not go into the myriad of reasons why these commissioners have lost all believability; however, I feel I must respond to two of their main accusations as they relate directly to both my sincerity and also the Brush Valley issue. 

<p>In what is described as my "first big lie," Cwalina and Lewis claim that my assertion that they advocate the destruction of Brush Valley is false. It is hard to imagine, however, any sane person believing that the plowing, draining and blacktopping that will occur in Brush Valley will not result in its total and permanent destruction, at least as far as it being a natural resource. I have seen the Bureau of Prisons site selection book and they are interested in obtaining the entire valley floor, including the reservoir. Anything that is left of the valley after the bulldozers are done will be enjoyed only by criminals. Mr. Cwalina often speaks about some grand vision where recreation and more prison building can co-exist in Brush Valley. What a foolish dream this is. While the Brush Valley Preservation Association opposes any construction in Brush Valley, it would be interesting to see a detailed plan of Mr. Cwalina's scheme. I'm sure it would be quite entertaining. 

<p>I would also like to address the commissioners' statement that no new bonds would be floated to purchase Brush Valley. I have found numerous references to this plan for a $7 million bond in the newspaper archives. If more bonds are not used to pay for Brush Valley, just where would the money come from? As Northumberland County virtually drowns in a sea of red ink, as the county sells and resells its assets, and as more tax increases loom on the horizon, just how then do the commissioners intend to make such an expensive purchase? It is certainly no lie to say that Northumberland County can't afford another of Cwalina and Lewis's financial plots. 

<p>On a related subject, it now seems that the Shamokin-Coal Township Joint Sewer Authority has finally admitted that yes, they will offer the federal prison system incentives, paid by us, of course, to build in Brush Valley. It was stated in a recent news article that the sewer authority's solicitor was asked why Sunnyside and Overlook should be expected to help pay for improvements to existing lines, even though theirs will be completely new. Part of the solicitor's response was that they should help pay for economic development projects, such as a new prison. If the rumored $29 million for such improvements becomes reality, it means all Shamokin-Coal Township Sewer customers' monthly rates may double. I question the fairness of our citizens being burdened by this increase, while at the same time being forced to subsidize a federal prison's sewage service, in effect helping to destroy Brush Valley against our will. 

<p>As anyone who learns the real facts can plainly see, what the majority commissioners call "lies" are simply bits of information that cast them and their plans in a true, but unflattering light, and who they call a liar is just someone who discovers this. I was slightly offended by their statements toward me, but one must consider the source.
