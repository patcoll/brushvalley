<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association has recently received a correspondence from Foster Wheeler Mt. Carmel Inc. stating their company's interest in and support of BVPA's plan to use the Natalie sites for industrial development. 

<p>Foster Wheeler operates the Co-generation plant near Marion Heights in Northumberland County. This plant economically produces electricity and steam by burning the waste from past coal mining operations, (culm).

<p>The burner utilizes a process known as fluidized bed combustion. This is very environmentally friendly because not only is the burning process extremely clean and efficient, but at the same time it helps rid our area of the ugly, polluting culm. 

<p>Plant Manager Joe Camerini believes that developing the Natalie sites would help insure his plants operation for many years to come. This is very important for our area. Clean, abundant and inexpensive power would help attract and hold industry. Also, the longer Foster wheeler is in operation the more our local environment benefits by disposing of more culm, while at the same time using the clean, safe ash to fill in abandoned strip mines.

<p>Perhaps most critical is the fact that Foster Wheeler and its adjoining greenhouses employ 120 local workers. Development of the Natalie sites would insure their futures for a long time to come, in addition to how ever many other jobs would be created. 

<p>Another important point to consider is what the impact would be on water rates if Foster Wheeler shuts down. They currently use 1 million gallons of water per day, 20-25% of Consumers Pennsylvania's total sales.

<p>The benefits of the Foster Wheeler plant are the latest in a
growing list of facts that BVPA believes make the Natalie sites much more logical than Brush Valley for any development, including a prison.

<p>BVPA is certain that when these and all other facts are made pubic, Northumberland County residents will agree.
