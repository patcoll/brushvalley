Due to all the claims, counterclaims, and accusations surrounding the ongoing Brush Valley and county finance issues, I feel that I should at this time make clear the facts, as we have uncovered them, and restate our goals and beliefs. I do this not only as the president of the 400-plus (yes, that's how many) members of the Brush Valley Preservation Association, but also as a lifelong resident of Northumberland County and Coal Township.
</P>

<P>BVPA has been accused of not wanting to meet with the groups involved in the Brush Valley issue to talk about the situation. This, however, is simply not true. Early on, the BVPA met with representatives of the owners of Brush Valley, a representative of the Northumberland County Industrial Development Authority and Congressman Kanjorski. I myself have spoken personally to Commissioner Cwalina over the phone.
</P>

<P>Their answers to our concerns were well scripted, unified, and in no uncertain terms indicated that they would not ever even entertain the possibility of anything other than the purchase and destruction of Brush Valley. Also, none of the many press releases these individuals have put out since then have shown that their position has at all softened.  BVPA even went so far as to have one of our members attend a meeting of the Brush Valley Chamber of Commerce, but when he began to present our findings on alternate prison sites he was quickly silenced. There seems to be little room for dissent in the Chamber, as seen in their misguided assertion that only the destruction of greenfields will bring us industry, excluding any other ideas at all.
</P>

<P>BVPA invites these and other groups to contact us, but if they persist in calling for the degradation and loss of Brush Valley, there is little to talk about.
</P>

<P>BVPA would like to state, now and forever, once and for all, and with no strings attached, that we ARE in favor of a federal prison being built somewhere in our area. However, Brush Valley is NOT an acceptable or logical location. We have spent much time and energy finding alternate sites, but the controlling powers are not interested because that would deviate from their master plan.
</P>

<P>Some people may wonder why BVPA is investigating our local officials and government finances. To begin with, we are citizens and have that right, just as all citizens do. More related to the Brush Valley issue is the fact that large amounts of taxpayer money will be used if the county purchases Brush Valley. It will no doubt come from another, or possibly an existing bond issue, therefore sinking our county further into debt (estimated at $44-plus million already).
</P>

<P>The county dose not seem to want all the expenses of their plans to be known, and contrary to their claims, they have not been cooperative in releasing documents. Only after contacts with our legal representatives did we get any of what was requested.
</P>

<P>Such things as bond fees and interest are not often part of the glowing sales pitch given to the taxpayers. In the last bond issue, the resale of Mountain View Manor, a quarter of a million was spent on related costs (the two solicitors alone received 20 grand on top of their retainer fees), and the interest has been projected to be over $12 million.
</P>

<P>BVPA also wants to inform the public about incentives offered to lure these prisons to our area.  When I reported that the state prison had its sewage tapping fee paid for by our county authority while fixed income residents would be paying $12,000, representatives of the authority said basically it's OK because the prison is a multi-million dollar complex and can pay big wages. I wonder how the residents feel about that. Are we all comfortable with being forced to subsidize a project that in reality will benefit very few of us?
</P>

<P>There are many, many other problems the BVPA has uncovered and we will be releasing more information soon. Concerning the above matters I would like to say to the county, who stated in a recent article that I should "get real," maybe they should get honest.
</P>

<P>It is now undeniable that our area is in decline, and while another prison, built in the right place, may help, it won't stop our downward spiral.  This is painfully obvious to anyone living in our area. Certainly more bond floating and is not the answer, and we must face the fact that talk about our coal heritage and other fluff articles in the papers serve only as distractions. (The real heroes were the miners and their families, not the industry itself). The policies of the past have failed, as have our leaders. It is time for new ideas. Making our community better for its people and more attractive to the outside world by preserving Brush Valley would be a great beginning.
