<p>This is the first of several planned news releases by the Brush Valley Preservation Association.
<p>Many issues are involved in the argument against the development of Brush Valley. Some people object because of environmental concerns.
Other believe the county is in no position financially to undertake such an expensive project. And still others question the purchase and use of Brush Valley when other, more suitable sites may be available.
<p>We, (the Brush Valley Preservation Association) have been looking at these and other related issues for some time now and have uncovered many interesting facts and information. The B.V.P.A. has contacted local, state, and Federal agencies, elected officials and representatives.  We have also talked to several interested conservation and environmental groups.
<p>Although the data we have gathered is great, and
it's sources varied, there is one common thread running through it all.
That is the importance and weight of public opinion.
<p>Almost without exception every person we talked
to noted that the will of the people, if focused on the right places, CAN
and WILL make a difference.
<p>The B.V.P.A. urges concerned citizens to contact
their township supervisors, mayors,
<br>councilmen and community leaders and voice opposition to this
project. Of great importance is to call the county commissioners
office in Sunbury, as they are the main architects of the development plan.
Contact your state Representative Bob Belafanti and
<br>Senator Ed Helfrick to express your concerns. It may be also informative
to look up the Brush Valley Chamber of Commerce on the internet and ask
it's members what their stance is.
<p>Possibly the greatest impact concerned citizens
can have is to call the Federal Bureau
<br>of Prisons site selection department at 202-514-6470. It is my
understanding that all questions, especially environmental, must be addressed
by the B.O.P., and since the Federal prison is so pivotal in this matter,
input to the B.O.P. could really make a difference.
<p>Non-government groups such as the Sierra Club,
and smaller local groups like ourselves or the Shamokin Creek Restoration
Alliance can also help you stay informed.
<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association hopes
to address these issues in more detail in future articles, but till then
it is important for the people of the area to make themselves heard.
You have the right to choose the direction of your county.
