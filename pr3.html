<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association has been actively pursuing
feasible and realistic approaches for maintaining Brush Valley as a public
recreational park. Through contacts with state and private entities,
BVPA has learned that financial assistance is available through many resources
for the preservation of this land.
<p>BVPA believes that the first step towards economic development is increasing
the quality of life in the community.&nbsp; Open space and recreational
facilities are a major consideration of large and small businesses when
relocating to a new area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Encouraging businesses to come to
one’s community is a very competitive process.&nbsp; Therefore, it is important
to have a community that will appeal to respectable and responsible businesses.
<p>The Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources (DCNR) offers
grants to assist municipalities and organizations with purchasing and rehabilitating
land for recreation.&nbsp; BVPA has learned that DCNR would consider acquisition
of the Brush Valley lands eligible for grant funding.&nbsp; Conservancies
can work with Consumer’s PA Water Company to purchase this land and seek
a 50% matching grant from DCNR.&nbsp; With the cooperation of Consumers
Water, Brush Valley can be purchased and preserved as a public park or
open space area at a very minimal cost, if any cost at all to the local
government.&nbsp; For example, Consumer’s Water can sell the land to a
municipality or a conservancy for 50% of the fair market value.&nbsp; DCNR
will then contribute the other half as matching funds.&nbsp; This acquisition
does not cost the taxpayers a cent.&nbsp; It is very feasible, just look
at Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light (PP&amp;L).&nbsp; PP&amp;L (<a href="http://www.ppl-inc.com/environment/index.html">http://www.ppl-inc.com/environment/index.html</a>)
has worked with DCNR for the last several years in selling land for conservation
purposes and maintaining recreational facilities for public use.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Currently, PP&amp;L owns and maintains four parks for public recreation.
<p>BVPA has contacted organizations and agencies including the Pennsylvania
Game Commission, The Northcentral Pennsylvania Conservancy, Audubon Society,
Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and The Nature Conservancy to obtain
their support against the development of Brush Valley.&nbsp; The Sierra
Club, Green Susquehanna, and Shamokin Creek Restoration Alliance have already
publicly opposed any industrial development in Brush Valley.&nbsp; Conservancies,
sportsmen groups and the PA Game Commission can work together with local
governments and/or landowners to purchase land for conservation, conservancies
often purchasing the land themselves and conveying it to a local government
or organization.&nbsp; As an added benefit, landowners are exposed to significant
tax incentives when they donate land for conservation.
<p>Feasibility studies are also available and funded through DCNR to determine
if a piece of land can be preserved for public recreation or open space.
DCNR could pay 50% of the total cost of a feasibility study.&nbsp; If possible,
in kind support can be used to make up the remaining portion of the cost.&nbsp;
This study can help develop a comprehensive long-range plan that would
address our community’s recreation, park and open space needs and a preservation
plan for Brush Valley.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Northumberland County recently received a $23,000 DCNR grant to inventory
the county’s natural areas.&nbsp; BVPA also has learned that it would be
possible to complete the Natural Areas Inventory of Brush Valley first.&nbsp;
With the permission of Consumers Water and the County, this study could
form the foundation for a more comprehensive conservation and development
plan for Brush Valley.
<p>BVPA is not against economic development as long as it is done responsibly.
