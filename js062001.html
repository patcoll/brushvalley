<p>Paxinos: Contrary to what was previously reported, BVPA supports any environmentally sound site for a prison other than the Trout Run portion of Brush Valley. 

<p>Yes, we have concentrated our efforts at Natalie East for these reasons: 

<p>1. The Natalie East site is more than 600 acres in size and about 90 percent of the acreage is owned by Philadelphia Suburban Water, the parent of our local Roaring Creek Water Division. 

<p>2. Selling this land for the construction of the prison would guarantee a high volume water user that the water company so desperately wants. Also, it would provide the company the benefit of selling land it does not need. 

<p>3. BVPA research indicates a high probability of over 200 acres being clean and green regarding mining. 

<p>4. Commercial infrastructure needed to support a prison could be a head start in providing other sites to attract more needed industry. 

<p>5. BVPA has hope that the selection of the Natalie East site would result in more favorable consideration by the water company for the profitable sale of Trout Run Valley for preservation and recreation to benefit residents and customers in their local service area. 

<p>Residents of eastern Northumberland County are at a time of decision that will affect the quality of life available to our families and future generations. The Trout Run portion of Brush Valley is a rare jewel as a natural resource and should be protected as such. Over 2,000 acres of mountainsides, valleys, 9 1/2 acres of dams, a continual bubbling sand spring and abundant wildlife. 

<p>Will this nature area be forever lost as a benefit to residents and customers of this Philadelphia Suburban Company service area?
