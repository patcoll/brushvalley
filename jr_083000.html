As we are all well aware, eastern Northumberland County is in dire need of industrialization. And the possibility exists that an industrial area can be made with proper, intelligent planning. A federal prison could be the starting point for this to happen. An area in and around Natalie would be an ideal place to begin this industrialization in eastern Northumberland County. 

<p>Locating a federal prison on the Natalie Mountain top along with developing that area for industry would do more for employment than putting a prison in Brush Valley. We could have eastern Northumberland County grow with a state park in that valley and developing Natalie into a large industrial complex. 

<p>This is called long-range planning. A prison in Brush Valley and no room for further industrial development is poor planning, to say the least. If you'd read the prison scoping manual, you'd see that they intend to take the choice 900 acres in the valley, leaving the worst of the 900 acres for Northumberland county. These remaining 900 acres are virtually undevelopable. What a waste of the taxpayers' money. And Northumberland County taxes have increased this year and will increase again next year to pay for this lack of intelligent planning. 

<p>Also, the cost to industry has risen with this increase in taxes. That is a disincentive to industry wanting to locate within Northumberland County. Also not being looked at is the expense that will be incurred by the taxpayer for the reconstruction of the future entrance to Brush Valley in the Route 54 area. A major highway reconstruction will be needed before that side of the valley could be accessed from Route 54. Whereas, at the Natalie site, Route 54 is easily accessible with no needed major construction in this immediate area. In the future, with proper planning and foresight, as the area grows with industry, highway improvements can be implemented at Natalie. The curve at Locust Gap will be straightened out in the near future which will make traffic flow easier and more safely through that area. That is a plus for industrial development. An industrial leader seeing the Route 54 area near Brush Valley will realize that without a major reconstruction there, the only way into the valley will be through <p>Shamokin and the congested Cameron Bridge area. Another disincentive to growth. 

<p>I think the Natalie area is going to prove to be the growth area for the future industrialization of eastern Northumberland County. If we all would work together towards this goal, we and our children and grandchildren would benefit. As the plan is now, a prison in Brush Valley with no room for any future industrial development will not do anything for eastern Northumberland County. Land that has ready access to highways along with room for industrial growth is what is needed. Natalie is the perfect place to start. Brush Valley just does not have enough room for industry and a prison along with its poor highway access. We are doomed to failure once again by a lack of intelligent long range planning.
