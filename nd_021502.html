<p>Preserving Brush Valley is a belief that has echoed through the voices of BVPA 
members and supporters over the last two years.   Fighting the "Brush Valley Prison” adversaries, BVPA has established a theoretical foundation for preserving 
Brush Valley based on the imminent environmental threats of destroying such a 
pristine area as well as the economic and social benefits that Brush Valley, 
in its natural state, could generate for our community.
 
<p>”Brush Valley Prison” proponents have disagreed all along with BVPA's conviction that 
Brush Valley is far too valuable to destroy.  After the BVPA submitted Natalie East as an alternate site, these individuals continued to claim Brush Valley was the only site where the prison could be built.  Arguing mining issues as their main concern with Natalie East, these “Brush Valley Prison” proponents attempted to convince the public that the BVPA was anti-prison for proposing what they claimed to be an unviable site.  

<p>According to “Brush Valley Prison” proponents, it was Brush Valley or nothing, and they 
used every opportunity to make their claim. The Chamber of Commerce hosted a 
meeting in Brush Valley declaring it the perfect location for a prison. A 
state representative with no educational background in mining alleged that 
Natalie East was full of bootleg mines.  The county Emergency Management 
Office even suggested that the Natalie East site was plagued with underground 
fires.  

<p>Most blatantly of all, the county commissioners, who claim responsibility for 
luring the BOP to our area, submitted only two sites, one site of course 
being Brush Valley, the other Natalie West, an undermined piece of land.  
Why, if the commissioners were trying so hard to bring a prison to 
Northumberland County, would they submit only two sites, one of which being, 
according to their own definition, an unviable site?  Perhaps, even before 
the BOP even became involved, it was Brush Valley or nothing.  

<p>Continuing to claim Natalie East was not a viable site, “Brush Valley Prison” proponents began to suggest that it wasn't our community leaders that would make the final decision on the placement of a prison, but the BOP, itself. Of course, the BOP would like nothing more than to buy a large portion of Brush Valley to build prisons.  In fact, the BOP cares only about buying land and building prisons. . . not about the environment and certainly not about our community.

<p>Thankfully, the BVPA pursued the involvement of state and federal regulatory 
agencies to determine if what the BOP was proposing truly was detrimental to 
our environment.  These agencies had very strong views against the construction 
of a prison in Brush Valley.  Comments from the PA Department of Conservation 
& Natural Resources, PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), PA Fish 
& Game Commission, US Department of Interior and the US Environmental 
Protection Agency all described concerns with the proposed project and 
strongly suggested that the BOP investigate and consider alternate sites.  Of 
course, this is what the BVPA has been saying all along.  Preserve Brush 
Valley. . build the prison in Natalie East.

<p>DEP's Director for the Bureau of Mining & Reclamation even submitted a mining 
report to the BOP confirming BVPA's convictions that there is indeed enough 
land in Natalie East to build a federal prison without concerns of 
undermining.  Copies of these and other documents have been posted on BVPA’s website.

<p>So what response have we received from the “Brush Valley Prison” proponents?  Well, the county still claims there are mine fires; the state representative still claims to be an expert on mining issues; the chamber still claims that the prison must go in Brush Valley; and they all still claim that if the BOP decides to build in Brush Valley, then it must be ok, regardless of the concerns from enforcement agencies.

<p>Recognizing the importance of preserving Brush Valley for future generations, BVPA has been working hard to locate the prison in Natalie East so Brush Valley can be spared.  BVPA has been meeting with state and federal parties to illustrate that Natalie East is suitable for a prison.  In addition, BVPA has discovered that the surrounding area would benefit from an updated sewage plant since the BOP could build a much-needed facility as a part of their prison construction.  They built such a facility for the federal prison in Schuylkill County.  In fact, 75% of the cost of the sewage plant in Gordon was paid for by the BOP and only 25% by the local taxpayers.  The land sold in Natalie East would also be much cheaper than Brush Valley and that should make the BOP (and federal 
taxpayers) happy. 

<p>A few things to consider. . . (1) if we don't get the prison, blame the “Brush Valley Prison” proponents, BVPA worked hard to bring the prison to Natalie East; (2) 
if the prison does come and it is built in Natalie East, let's make sure the 
BOP gives us everything that our community needs to sustain their facility 
(If that scares them off, then perhaps they are not the wonderful neighbor 
they claimed to be in the first place); (3) Stop and consider why the “Brush Valley Prison” proponents MUST have the prison in Brush Valley; and (4) Do you want 
the BOP making decisions for OUR community?
