<p>The Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club has unanimously voted to adopt the following resolution: "THE PENNSYLVANIA CHAPTER, SIERRA CLUB, SUPPORTS THE PRESERVATION OF THE TROUT RUN PORTION OF BRUSH VALLEY IN ITS NATURAL STATE." 

<p>Brush Valley, a 2,000-acre wooded valley, is located in eastern Northumberland County near the City of Shamokin.  The majority Commissioners of the county plan to purchase this tract of land from Philadelphia Suburban Corporation of Bryn Mawr for the construction of a federal prison complex and other industrial sites.  The land has a 9-acre lake, 95 acres of wetlands, a continuously bubbling sand spring and abounds with wildlife.  The wetlands, sand spring and wildlife habitat will be destroyed.  The water flowing through this valley is pure and uncontaminated.  With the plan to build a prison industrial complex within the valley, the future purity of this water will certainly be in question.  Much taxpayer money is going into the Governor Ridge's Growing Greener program to protect the Commonwealth's farms, open space, and wild areas.  Developing a prison at this location would run counter to this program.  Taxpayer dollars are also being spent to protect watersheds used for drinking water supplies.  
<p>How can a large development like this be proposed in such an area? 

<p>The Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club urges federal, state, and county officials to protect this land in its natural state. 

<p>The Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club has over 25,000 members.  It is part of the national Sierra Club, a conservation organization founded in 1892.
