BVPA, a grass roots organization dedicated to preserving Brush Valley, believes Congressman Kanjorski has misled the public when he recently affirmed the placement of a federal prison in Northumberland County.  BVPA believes the Congressman's comments were intended to discourage citizens from attending the upcoming meeting held by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

"The fight is NOT over and the prison has NOT been built," says a BVPA spokesperson.  "The BOP has a long and vigorous challenge of proving to both state and federal agencies that development in Brush Valley will not violate the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  NEPA is a federal law enacted in 1969 to protect the environment from irresponsible development.  

<p>Although the BOP and politicians continually state several sites are under consideration in Northumberland County, BVPA has learned through various contacts that Brush Valley is the primary target for development and other sites are being considered only because federal law requires the BOP to consider at least five sites.  As BVPA is supportive of a prison in Northumberland County, the organization encourages serious consideration of sites other than Brush Valley.  However, BVPA fears that this will not be the case; therefore, the group has decided to move further along in their fight to preserve the valley.

<p>BVPA is prepared for a long and intense legal battle to protect 2000 acres of Brush Valley.  The group has hired an environmental attorney whose credentials include the defeat of a corporate hog farm in rural Pennsylvania.  According to a BVPA spokesperson, "Our attorney has extensive background experience with challenging Environmental Impact Statements under NEPA and we are very confident of his abilities".  BVPA has also been consulting with other environmental and legal experts who have experience in similar issues.

<p>BVPA fears Kanjorski's comments will discourage residents from attending the BOP scoping meeting on Wednesday, May 31st, 7:00 PM at the Northumberland County Career Center.  BVPA urges members and concerned citizens to attend.  The meeting is a crucial part of the NEPA process because it enables citizens to question the BOP regarding the proposed prison.  Questions can relate to issues including but not limited to environmental, social and economic concerns.  These questions, under law, must be addressed by the BOP and each individual who presents a question at the meeting will receive a written response within a few months.  BVPA suggests submitting written questions at the meeting in case limited speaking time is a factor.

<p>BVPA wants to reaffirm that the prison is NOT a done deal and the organization is shocked by Congressman Kanjorski's ignorance of the NEPA process.  Being an U.S. Representative, Kanjorski should know that no one, least of all the BOP, is immune to this environmental law.  Also, due to his strong opinion on this issue, BVPA questions the Congressman's position on environmental issues.  "Kanjorski doesn't seem to understand or respect the value of open space to community like ours", according to a BVPA spokesperson, "he believes any piece of land can be compromised and destroyed for the sake of possible economic growth.  That just isn't responsible planning."

<p>Finally, BVPA urges the community to join the group and become a member.  "The organization is growing strong with over 100 members, but we need the support of all concerned citizens.   The future of Northumberland County should be in our hands, not the Bureau of Prisons."  For further information write BVPA at P.O. Box 301, Shamokin, PA  17872 or email brushvalley@mail.com.
