<p>In a letter to Governor Ridge, BVPA asked that a moratorium be placed on the Prison Project in
Northumberland County until a natural inventory study is completed and analyzed.  According to a BVPA spokesperson, "BVPA learned several months ago that Northumberland County received a $28,700 grant from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) to perform a natural inventory of the area (Please find the enclosed article.) The Nature Conservancy (TNC) received the contract to complete the study and, upon request of DCNR, agreed to begin the study in Brush Valley.  Unfortunately, nearly seven months have elapsed and the county has failed to finalize the contract with TNC and permit the study to commence.  As winter approaches, the study will need to be postponed until warmer weather can offer a more desirable venue for studying wildlife.  BVPA fears that the county intentionally delayed the study to eliminate any environmental obstacles during the development of the prison."

Currently, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is conducting an Environmental Impact Study (EIS).  BVPA suspects that this study will not consist of the intense research that would be associated with TNC's inventory and descriptive report.

Following the same Smart Growth initiatives of Ridge's administration, BVPA states that the Brush Valley Watershed should be preserved.  Situated within an anthracite coal region, BVPA feels that this 2,000 acre tract of land is the last of the area's natural resources.  Also, BVPA argues, as a park, Brush Valley would provide far more benefits to the community (e.g., tourism, increased quality of life, increased property values, etc.) than developed for industry.  In addition, BVPA has researched and studied alternate sites for a prison and industrial development and believes that our community could have both a prison AND beautiful open space.  Rep. Robert Belfanti stated when the natural inventory grant was announced, "preserving our open lands and conserving natural and environmental resources is an important part of growth and quality of life in Northumberland County.  This project, assisted by the state grant, will help the county gauge what its resources are and what needs to be done to improve 
and enhance those resources."  BVPA agrees with Rep. Belfanti's statement and feels that the natural inventory study must be completed before a final decision is made.
