<b><center><font face="vivaldi" size=+3>Contact the owner of Brush
Valley!!</font></center></b>

<p><font face="BernhardMod BT">Philadephia Surburban Corporation is the
true owner of Pennsylvania Consumers Water Co., Inc. and therefore the
owner of Brush Valley.&nbsp; PSC most likely will ultimately call the shots.&nbsp;
They are a large corporation that may not have much interest in a small
community like ours.&nbsp; Unless we change their mind!!!&nbsp; Contacting
PSC will illustrate the public opposition that has grown from the development
of Brush Valley.&nbsp; Write them or email them your concerns today!!!
