The Brush Valley Preservation Association is proud to announce the
endorsements of several influential local and state elected officials.
These individuals agree with the basic goals of the BVPA.  These goals
include the preservation of Brush Valley in it's natural state, seeking
funding to acquire the valley and open it for public recreation, and
using an alternate site to build the prison in Northumberland County. 
<p>
The following individuals feel, as we do, that the current County
agenda, to purchase and develop Brush Valley, is environmentally and
economically irresponsible, and have stated their intent to assist the
BVPA.
<p>
One of our most dedicated supporters is Merle Phillips, Majority Caucus
Administrator, Pa House of Representatives.  In a recent letter to the
BVPA he writes "I would like to re-emphasize to your group that I
wholeheartedly support your efforts to preserve Brush Valley and believe
that your group's effort is to be commended.  You can count on my
support throughout this process." 
<p>
In a correspondence to the Department of Conservation & Natural
Resources, Senator Edward Helfrick
wrote " I appreciate our recent discussion relating to Brush Valley in
Northumberland County, as well as several staff contacts on this issue.
I am pleased to know of the Departments interest in this matter. While I
am not in opposition to the location of a federal prison on a portion of
the site if no suitable alternatives can be identified, I believe Brush
Valley should be preserved in a natural state.  I look forward to
continued discussion relating to Brush Valley."
<p>
State Representative Robert W. Godshall, Chairman of the House Tourism
and Recreation Development Committee has sent to us a statement which
reads in part, "as chairman of the House Tourism and Recreational
Development Committee, I am writing this letter in support of the BVPA's
efforts to preserve a 2,000 acre portion of Brush Valley located near
Trout Run...the Idea of one day having an area in Brush Valley for
tourists to enjoy nature in a peaceful setting would be very welcoming
to the many visitors from the urban areas."
<p>
Chuck Erdman, Northumberland County Controller, e-mailed us this letter.
"I support the efforts of the BVPA to identify alternate sites for a
federal prison in Northumberland County and secure funding for the
preservation of Brush Valley as a public park.  I am hopeful that an
acceptable site can be found that would allow the county's residents to
reap the economic benefits of a prison while protecting the natural
asset that is Brush Valley."
<p>
County Commissioner Sam Deitrich, while being very much in favor of
building a prison some where in Northumberland County, also has stated
that he supports the BVPA's goals of finding a site other than Brush
Valley.
<p>
Jim Brett, the Governors Sportsman Advisor, has become  involved and is
currently in contact with many officials in Harrisburg.
<p>
Mrs. Eleanor Kuhns, former Northumberland County and Coal Township
Commissioner, and current BVPA member, has been working tirelessly,
using her considerable knowledge of county politics, to help the BVPA
cause.
<p>
These, and many other supporters show that there is wide spread
political and public backing for the efforts of the BVPA.  But is it
having an impact? A response from John Oliver, Secretary of the
Department of Conservation and Natural resources, to a letter written by
Representative Phillips, shows that it is making an impact.  In part the
response reads "DCNR will carefully consider the draft environmental
impact statement when it is completed.  Should the local officials
determine that all or a portion of Brush Valley be preserved as open
space, DCNR could povide funding assistance. "
This shows once and for all that Brush Valley CAN be a public park.
<p>
Over the last six or seven months it has become clear that the general
public, state agencies, and now even many polititians support the BVPA.
The BVPA would like to make it clear that come election time we, as well
as our families and friends, will remember who did, and who did not
support us.
