<p>Shamokin: Many people I talk to have the idea that a federal prison will result in hundreds of jobs for "anyone" who wants to be employed. Many people are going to be very disappointed when they learn what the minimum qualifications are for the job of corrections officer. 

<p>The minimum qualifications for a federal corrections officer are: Under the age of 37, a full four-year course of study in any field leading to a bachelor's degree from an accredited school or possession of a bachelor's degree, or the equivalent of at least three years of full-time general experience performing duties such as providing assistance, guidance and direction to individuals; counseling individuals, responding to emergency situations, supervising, managing, teaching or instructing individuals, or selling products or services, or a combination of undergraduate education and general experience equivalent to three years of full-time experience. 

<p>So, just how many local residents are going to meet these minimum standards for a job in a federal prison? 

<p>Another item of importance is the salary. I've heard anyone who gets one of these jobs will be paid $40,000 a year. The truth is, the starting salary for a corrections officer is $21.370, plus benefits, of course. But this is not even close to the pay that many people hear they will get if employed by a federal prison. 

<p>A job at a federal prison is not going to be the financial windfall for the average working man that the people promoting this prison are leading them to believe. Who will be the main beneficiaries if this prison is built here? The contractors and land developers! 

<p>It's time the politicians stop telling people how great this project will be when they should be telling the facts. The facts are that if you are over the age of 37 and/or you do not have a college degree or selected experience, forget about being employed at this proposed prison. 

<p>Politicians, get jobs here that pay well for the average working man or woman, whether they be 22 or 52. With a GED, high school diploma or college degree. Make this a far and equal employment area for all, not just a select few.
