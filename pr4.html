BVPA is a growing local grassroots organization formed nearly two months ago to preserve a 2000 acre tract of land.  The conservation group is focused on the environmental concerns of the community and opposes any development in the Trout Run area of Brush Valley.  However, BVPA would like to stress that the organization is not opposed to a federal prison in Northumberland County and fully recognizes the need for economic growth.  BVPA has called on the Northumberland County Commissioners to make a real effort to bring not just a prison, but any quality employment into this area.  
     
<p>To illustrate their support of a prison in this county, BVPA recently submitted two viable alternate prison sites, both of which were researched extensively through much time and effort of the organization's volunteers. Unfortunately, these locations were quickly rejected by the county.  Upon reading the county's comments on the two sites, BVPA called the county engineers to obtain a copy of the report that would substantiate the county's findings.  The organization was told that one did not exist.  Apparently the county used the BVPA web site along with some other state maps to simply deem the sites as unusable by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  The BOP has not responded to BVPA's alternate sites as of this date but has confirmed they will include them in their Environmental Impact Statement.
				
<p>John Faraguna, President of the BVPA, stated "in no uncertain terms we are opposed to the exploitation of Brush Valley for a prison or any other type of development.  Our growing membership does not believe that the possibility of the alleged economic gains from a prison justifies the loss of such a valuable natural resource.  With the funding that we have located we are sure Brush Valley could be made into public recreation area that would benefit our community far more in terms of economics and quality of life."

<p>"We are prepared to do all we can to make this a reality. We currently have retained an environmental attorney and are working with various experts to ensure the integrity of this land.  We are becoming more knowledgeable about the legal aspects of this issue, and we, along with our experts, will be monitoring every step of the proposed project to ensure environmental concerns are addressed as dictated by State and Federal law."  

<p>BVPA strongly urges the public to attend the Bureau of Prisons meeting May 31.  It will be the best opportunity to express opinions on this very important subject.
 
<p>Faraguna adds, "It's your taxes.  It's your community.  It's our future."
