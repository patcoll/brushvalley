Recently, Richard Subasic of Consumers Water, Roaring Creek Division, stated that the 2,000 acres of Trout Run would NOT be preserved for a park. The Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) has tried very hard to preserve this land and has not only found funding to purchase the property but willing parties to help in the acquisition process. The land would benefit our community in so many ways by providing safe, clean open space for public enjoyment. But the water company refuses to see the possibilities of Trout Run as a park. Instead it is holding its hand out, like many of their corporate peers, for a chunk of corporate welfare. 

<p>Sure, other utility companies like PP&L are trying hard to make the communities they serve better by contributing to the quality of life, preserving land for recreation and making better decisions for the environment and local economy. PP&L currently maintains thousands of acres of land for public enjoyment throughout Pennsylvania. Five PP&L-owned recreational facilities provide opportunity for sightseeing, bird-watching, hiking, camping and numerous other activities. What does our water company give back to our community? 

<p>Nothing, at least in taxes! Our water company seems to need our help, our charity if you will. According to the county assessor's office, the water company land (including Trout Run) is exempt for county taxes. How many tax dollars has our water company saved? In addition, Subasic has made it very clear that the land has always been intended for commercial development, yet the land is not zoned as a commercial property. Surprisingly, it is zoned conservation! Conservation. What a great concept! 

<p>Our water company also needs our help to earn more profits. Pennsylvania Consumers earned over $20 million in 1999, but it doesn't seem to be enough! You are probably rolling up your sleeves right now, wondering "How can I help our poor water company?" Very simple! We, the taxpayers will subsidize their profits! 

<p>First, the water company wants the county to purchase Trout Run for $4.7 million. Second, the water company wants the federal government to build a prison and use approximately 300,000 gallons of water each day. Finally, the water company wants the county to pursue state development grants to establish an industrial development park in Trout Run, thus providing the water company with even more customers! We the taxpayers will be able to donate our county, state and federal tax dollars to the water company without even leaving the comfort of our home! Isn't it wonderful? The water company won't have to pay a cent! 

<p>And what do we get back in return, if they are actually fortunate enough to lure industry to this area (doubtful since the water company has been trying to sell that land for over 10 years with no luck even WITH the infrastructure in place)? We'll get some jobs (we should hope). Increased stress on our local infrastructure (Just look at Cameron Bridge now! Do you think it can sustain more traffic?). A need for more teachers in our schools? A larger sewage plant (possibly)? More police officers? Of course, we'll pay for all these and much more through our local taxes. But the water company will prosper. That is what's important, right? 

<p>Now before you get those checkbooks out to donate to our poor water company, just consider BVPA's alternative. The water company can sell Trout Run for recreation (grants and conservancies will assist in this purchase). The water company can sell Natalie East (yes, they own that land, too) for industrial development and the placement of a federal prison. The company will receive tax breaks for conserving Trout Run and the revenue from new water customers at Natalie East. Land recycling grants that are available through the state for reclaiming land can be used to prepare Natalie East for industrial development. The water company would help increase the quality of life in our area by providing quality open space. Revenue from local tourism (the second largest industry in Pennsylvania, by the way) would increase. Companies and potential residents would view our area as progressive and resourceful. The water company would receive praise and recognition for giving back to the community and preserving a piece  of land that we really could not afford to lose. 

<p>All I ask of Mr. Subasic is to consider the possibilities of not just looking out for his own company's interests, but the interests of this community! Perhaps, he doesn't plan on sticking around long enough to see what this community can become. Perhaps, he doesn't care, but anyone truly interested in making this community better would consider the possibilities
