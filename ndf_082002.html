<p>I read Mr. Dobson's letter to the editor with utter delight. . I am so glad that you 
are interested in learning from the Brush Valley Preservation Association and 
understanding the true opportunities our community holds. BVPA has extended 
the offer early on, and will extend the offer again, to sit down with local 
development officials and yourself to discuss the process for developing an 
actual strategy that would enable us to move in a progressive direction.

<p>Our "economic development expertise" that you describe in your article is 
simply the process of educating ourselves on what programs are available to 
strenghten our communities; learning what other successful communities are doing; understanding 
that the needs of ALL of our residents (not just a select few) matter; and 
realizing the importance of developing a comprehensive plan. 

And as far as siting industry. . what you call skill, is what we believe to 
be nothing more than common sense. Successful communities do not ruin their 
most valuable resources for the sake of potential growth. Progess is not 
destroying our assets. . . I would have thought the Chief Executive Officer 
of a regional chamber of commerce would have understood that concept.

<p>Again, I do appreciate your interest in our association. Yes, as your article 
reads, sometimes "it's more difficult to be "FOR" something than it is to 
be "AGAINST"".  But as for your arrogant insistance of siting a prison in Brush Valley
(and speaking as a resident of this county who is very tired of being told by our "leaders" what is good for me), 
I can't help but be honored to stand alongside  over 3,000 members, supporters and activists of BVPA
 that have made your fight all the more difficult.

<p>Nicole Faraguna
<br>Vice President, BVPA
