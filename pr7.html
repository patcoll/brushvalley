After attending the Federal Bureau of Prisons meeting the other
night there can be no doubt that there are certain groups of people who
are very much in favor of a prison(s) in Brush Valley.  But do these
well scripted and organized groups speak for the average resident of
Northumberland County?  Or are their interests more personal?  
<p>     These people were certainly passionate about the benefits of this
prison.  From what they claim everything from the economy to civic pride
to  juvenile delinquency will be vastly improved by a Brush Valley
prison.  Even our water rates will go down.  (I wish some one from the
water company would actually promise that one)  But perhaps it would do
more for some than others.
<p>     Who is supporting the Brush Valley prison?  Well, the county was
well represented. ( The signs were a nice touch, whoever paid for them.)
Also in attendance were real estate
brokers and other businessmen who may make some money off a prison.  The
water company, of course, who stand to make millions on the deal,  and
assorted politicians and other officials who think plowing over Brush
Valley is a great idea. I think it very unlikely, however, that they
truely have the good of the average citizen in mind.
<p>     About the only two groups who I feel had a legitimate reason for
wanting a prison were the trades union workers and the people who may
actually get hired as workers at a new prison, but these positions will
be far fewer than we are being told.
<p>     I feel more questions have been raised lately about this situation
than have been answered. For example, why does our County need to be the
real estae broker in this deal? What will they do with the useless land that will be left over after the
prison takes the developable 900 acres.  Do they actually have companies
waiting to come to Brush Valley, and if so, who? 

<p>Why does it have to be Brush Valley or no where?  That motto of the
B.O.P."can' t build anywhere near mined land" is getting tired. If this
land is good enough for our schools and homes, it's good enough for
prisoners. The Brush Valley Preservation Association has offered two
viable alternate sites, but they are not being seriously considered. Why
not?  

<p>Why has the economic benefits of recreation not been explored?
It's real. Hawk mountain brings seven million dollars to it's local
area, and it's just a bird watching preserve.  

<p>Why has none of our elected officials looked into state and private
funding to have some or all of Brush Valley bought for public use?  The
BVPA has, and we have found much money available.  Why do our local and state leaders keep saying that the water
company will sell this land to some one else when they have admitted
that it's to expensive to develop for most companies.  They also know
that environmental groups like ourselves could challenge development in
Brush Valley, be it governmental or private.  
<p>     Finally, why can't the county, the state, the BOP, and the water
company work with us to help find an acceptable site for a
Northumberland County prison?  We at the BVPA feel strongly that our
area needs this prison, as well as other good paying employment, but
destroying Brush Valley does not make sense, either environmentally or
economically. 
<p>     If Northumberland County is passed over for a prison,it will not be
the fault of the BVPA (whom I am very proud to be associated with).
However, the fault will be of our commissioners and other "leaders" who
lacked the foresight and knowledge to bring prisons, or any other decent
industry, to our area in a responsible way.
<p>     There are many possible results of putting the prison in Brush
Valley.  Some people will get average jobs. (if they are average for the
rest of the country, why are they great for us?)  Crime may or may not go up. Other industry may come, but that is not
likely. Who knows?
<p>   One thing is certain though.  Brush Valley, with all it's plants,
animals, beauty and potential, will be gone forever.
