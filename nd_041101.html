<p>The more I read about what other communities throughout the state and nation are doing to preserve their natural resources and open space, the more I worry about our own community leadership.  It's startling to consider that of all the political "leaders" that have been elected to serve our community. . only one has truly supported the preservation of Brush Valley.   Rep. Merle Phillips and his staff have been instrumental throughout the process, and we thank them for their efforts.

<p>But that leaves, (in case you were counting) three county commissioners, five township commissioners, one U.S. representative, one state senator, one state representative a mayor and a few city council persons who can't seem to understand the importance of preserving Brush Valley!   When you look at the photos of Brush Valley, you'll agree . . this land is a natural jewel. .it must be preserved!!   Even many of these elected officials have commented on its beauty and pristine nature. . yet they want it destroyed for the sake of a prison!  It doesn't make sense.

<p>All over the state, land is being preserved and protected from ruthless and excessive development.  Municipal leaders are developing thoughtful plans that ensure that the quality of life is preserved in their communities while building their economy in the  process.  It's all about "Smart Growth"!  C'mon guys, I know you've heard about it. . now just do something about it.  
Smart Growth means saving the land that should be preserved and building on the land that should be developed.   Preserve Brush Valley/Build on Natalie East.  Very Simple!!  
 
<p>Our neighbor, Schuylkill County, has put this theory into reality.  County Commissioner Stanley Tobash explained the need to reclaim the abandoned mines in his county, "we would like to get grants to use these 'brownfield' areas for industrial development, so we don't have to put industrial parks into wooded areas."   

<p>Not only is Schuylkill County officials promoting the preservation of wooded areas, but they are purchasing the land for a county-wide park system as well.  Their first purchase was Sweet Arrow Lake, located in Pine Grove.  Schuylkill County Commissioner Chairman Forrest Shadle said, "We're focusing on job development, but there's more to life than just jobs.  You need something after work and this [park] will hopefully give people an opportunity to spend their leisure time on weekends here at home [in Schuylkill County]." 

<p>And they don't just spend time, they spend money.  In fact, from tourism alone, Schuylkill County earned nearly $196 million in 1999.  Northumberland County only brought in $88 million.  

<p>Smart political leaders, like the Schuylkill County Commissioners, realize that natural space not only possesses environmental value but economic value, as well.  Preserving Brush Valley 
could stimulate our local economy in several ways.  The creation of a pubic park in Brush Valley would no doubt provide direct and indirect revenue while improving the overall quality of life.  Improving the quality of life will make our community more competitive when attracting new businesses to relocate to our area . . . (Note: Not many industries want to relocate to an area that can only boast dirty old coal mines as the main tourist attraction).
 
<p>Our area could be so much more. . .with sensible planning, strategic visioning and the right leadership, we can make this community whatever we want it to be.  You decide. . .are you content with the status quo or do you want more???

<p>This is an election year for many of the local officials.  The incumbents all seem to think that Brush Valley is disposable.  Let's prove to them that the only thing that IS disposable is our careless leadership!!!
