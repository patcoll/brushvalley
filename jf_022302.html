<p>As President of the Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA)I feel I should address a letter to the editor written by a Mr. George 
Kline (2-22-02). Although I have no insight as to his motives or sincerity, his letter is so riddled with groundless speculation, baseless assumptions, and factual ignorance, that it is more a vehicle for false propaganda and innuendoes than a useful conveyance of information. However, by speaking to his misguided assertions it offers me an opportunity to clarify and reaffirm the position of BVPA and better explain the Brush Valley situation.

<p>To begin with, Mr. Kline chants the same tired mantra that BVPA is anti-prison, and for some reason would like to see people unemployed.  This complete misrepresentation of the facts suggests that while Mr. Kline has mastered the art of writing to the newspaper, he is not very proficient in reading them.  For the last two years BVPA has published it's beliefs that a prison should be built at an alternate site in our area, preferably Natalie East. BVPA has, and still is, lobbying elected officials for help in securing the prison at Natalie. At the same time our local elected officials continue to claim Natalie is undermined, even though BVPA initiated a state report that proves unquestionably it is not. Why do they cling to the notion that it "must be Brush Valley"? If Brush Valley is rejected for a prison because of environmental concerns, as we believe it will, it will be the alternate site at Natalie, submitted and promoted by BVPA that will be our area's best hope of getting a prison. This is hardly the action of an anti-prison group.

<p>In an obvious attempt to vilify the BVPA, Mr. Kline points out that we are affiliated with other environmental groups, some of which having concerns about coal mining and burning.  Although BVPA was not formed to address this issue, we are respectful of the opinions of others with environmental concerns. Mr. Kline's comments do, however, illustrate a major problem in our area: We have lived in the shadow of coal, literally and figuratively, for too long. There is a general malaise that we tolerate simply because the "glory days" of "king coal" have passed.  BVPA feels that our community should adopt a progressive, forward facing path of advancement. We can no longer afford to use the past as an excuse for stagnation. We must overcome the "we are not worthy" and "that's pretty good for around here" attitude that now permeates our local identity. Policies that look to the future by protecting the environment, respecting quality of life, and seeking meaningful employment for more than just a few would be far more fitting tributes to the miners who helped build our community than glorifying an industry that maimed and killed so many of them.

<p>Mr. Kline goes on to assert that since Brush Valley is private property, neither BVPA, nor any one else, has the right to express an opinion as to how it will be used. In response I would like to ask Mr. Kline who he thinks will finance this project? Of course, we will, all of us, with our tax dollars.  Add to that the fact that there are environmental laws governing such a large and potentially destructive undertaking, and you see why "We the People" have not only the right, but also a responsibility to get involved. It's OUR taxes, OUR environment, and OUR community!

<p>Finally, Mr. Kline challenges BVPA to explain what we will tell our grandchildren if a prison is not built in Brush Valley. I believe I can answer for most, if not all, of our people. We will tell them we were proud to stand up in defense of the environment; proud that we put the good of our entire community ahead of any self-serving agendas; proud that we proved, once and for all, that individuals CAN and SHOULD have a hand in the course of their community; proud that we did what we believed was right.

<p>Now I ask you Mr. Kline, and all the supporters of destroying Brush Valley, when and if that beautiful valley is filled with prisons and the last bit of nature gone forever, when the ONLY employment left is in a jail, and when the only reason to come to our community is to be incarcerated, what will you tell your grandchildren?
