<p>July 15, 2002
<p>For over two and a half years the people of Northumberland County have been told, in no uncertain terms, that if we want to even be considered to receive the blessings and unimaginable wealth that another prison would bestow upon our humble community, we must be willing to pay numerous tributes to the almighty Bureau of Prisons, (BOP) including Brush Valley. But when people of logic and good conscience had the gall to question why such a beautiful and unique natural jewel need be sacrificed for our next jail, they were looked at as if they were ignorant idiots for even asking such a sacrilegious question.  "Why, don't you know, the BOP would never, ever, even consider building one of their precious prisons anywhere near land that might be affected by the mere possibility of past mining and/or lacking infrastructure" was the response universally chanted by politicians, businessmen, media people, and all others willing to accept the word of the BOP as the absolute truth. The only trouble is that it now appears to have been a lie.

<p>The Brush Valley Preservation Association (BVPA) has recently received copies of final Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) for several other prison sites.  These reports, commissioned by the BOP for the purpose of determining the best sites to build prisons, clearly describe past surface, as well as underground mining on the sites. Additionally, other problems that would surely have stopped further consideration of sites in our area, such as lack of infrastructure, don't seem to be a problem in other areas.

<p>The following quotes are taken from two FINLAL EIS' for the BOP"S preferred sites in   Gilmer County West Virginia (1998) and Martin County Kentucky (1997) 

<p>Gilmer County<br>
"… a portion (of the site) has been surface mined in the past and has since been reclaimed."
<p>
"… expenditures for the provision of potable water and waste water treatment services will be recouped through user fees."  (Read that, paid for by the BOP, not by the local citizens, as is done here)
<p>
"…a new waste water treatment facility is proposed to be designed, constructed, and  operated by the city of Glenville to serve the proposed project, as well as surrounding area".  (Wouldn't that be a good idea for the Mt. Carmel/Kulpmont area?)
<p>
"It should be noted that the Geological survey records indicate uncertainty as to the definite location of any subterranean shafts, as many of them were inaccessible during the survey".
<p>
"… (the site) consists of the regraded or "reclaimed" overburden and soils remaining after the coal had been extracted"
<p>
"…testing will also determine the physical extent of the deep mining reported to be on site…"
<p>
"Subsequent detailed development plans would definitely determine the need for special footings and /or other foundation requirements".

<p>
Matin County 
<p>
"Expenditures for (water and sewage services) will be recouped through user fees". 
<p>
"A new wastewater treatment facility is proposes to be designed, constructed and operated by the city of Plainsville to serve the proposed project as well as surrounding areas."
<p>
"The Honey Branch Site comprises a reclaimed former coal mine…"
<p>
"Portions of the (site) were previously surface mined…"
<p>
"…leases are in place to allow mining companies to mine, via underground methods, deeper reserves (on the site)".
<p>
". . .the study area has been strip mined…Additional areas are currently undergoing surface mining.."
<p>
"While the site was once subject to surface mining, portions of the site are currently being mined (underground) or are planned to be mined".  
 <p>
The BOP certainly doesn't seem to consider these problems to be nearly as significant in West Virginia and Kentucky as they are in Pennsylvania. And even if they do pose some problem the BOP appears to be more then willing to mitigate them.
<p>
But why not here?
<p>
Why is it that our area is somehow deemed to be less deserving of the same consideration given to other communities? Why does the BOP (a governmental agency that has forgotten that it exists because of, and is answerable to the public) demand that we destroy the last intact natural tract of land in our county when they have no problem using far less pristine land in other areas? 
<p>
As troubling as the issues concerning the BOP are, there is a even more important question to be asked: Why, when faced with overwhelming evidence that alternate prison sites (Natalie East and the FCI Schuylkill area) exist that ARE viable, and when confronted with the evidence that the BOP DOES use mined areas (as proven by their own EISs) do our governmental, business and community leaders continue to blindly support the contention that Brush Valley is the ONLY place a prison can be built? Why can't the people who were chosen to represent our interests find the courage to stand up and fight for us when we need them? 
<p>
It now appears that the interest stirred up by the BVPA and others has at least delayed, and possibly stopped, the prison project in Brush Valley.  If so, will our so- called leaders be comfortable with losing the economic potential (prison or anything decent for that matter) altogether simply because their egos and lack of initiative prevent them from considering alternate sites? Do they really believe that the people of Northumberland County are second class citizens not deserving of economic progress AND protection of our environment? Are they afraid of thinking and acting for themselves as well as their constituents, instead of blindly following the dictates of whatever group that buys them a reelection? Will the people who, for what ever reason, don't want another prison anywhere in our area continue to be treated like their feelings are insignificant and even treasonous? 
<p>
Unfortunately, the answers to the above questions appear to be yes. In the recent primary election only one candidate had the courage and common sense to state that, yes, indeed we do need the jobs, but there must be a better place to build a prison. All the others were content to tote the same line that we are indeed beggars, and therefore don't dare be choosy. This fatalistic attitude is what has made our area a punch line at the end of a running joke about backward, beaten down communities with little of their former pride and importance. 
<p>
We must change the self destructive course that has been set for our community or not only will we lose the prison, and possibly Brush Valley, but we will continue down a road of decline and decay that has already cost us so much.  And if our current leaders refuse to accept the responsibility of making this change, it's time for them to be replaced by those who would.
