Pennsylvania Power and Light, without them we would be in the dark, like much of California. But PPL is much more than a supplier of electricity, it is a provider of recreation to the residents of Pennsylvania. For instance, they maintain more than 25,000 acres of land for wildlife habitat and public recreation. 

<p> PPL Project Earth was created to improve environmental performance, educate children about energy and to offer recreational opportunities to families in Pennsylvania. PPL has stated that they are proud to say that they live where they work. They like the outdoors like everyone else. PPL invites you to explore the thousands of acres of woods, fields, lakes and wetlands near their power generating facilities. 

<p> In Pennsylvania, PPL owns and maintains four environmental preserves that attracted more than two million visitors last year. Montour Preserve has a 165 acre lake for fishing, boating and swimming, along with picnic areas, hiking trails and playgrounds. The Riverlands at Berwick provide the same amenities for residents. 

<p> Another program is PPL Trees for the Future. It teaches the importance of trees in the environment. The company provides information to schools with activity books as well as tree seedlings. 

<p> PPL should be commended for its environmental programs and recreational opportunities provided to us. 

<p> This brings me to Philadelphia Suburban Water Company, home offices near Philadelphia, the owners of Roaring Creek Water in Shamokin. They want to destroy the environment by selling off 2,000 prime acres in our watershed for a prison/industrial complex. They do not offer to plant trees, but to cut them down. They do not want to offer recreational opportunities to the consumers within their service area; even though the Brush Valley area has a lake for swimming, fishing and boating. The area is ideal for picnicking, hiking, bike riding, camping, walking and relaxing. The land abounds with wildlife and plants that will be gone forever. 

<p> Do they care about the environment? Do they do anything to educate our children on how important the environment is? Do they provide materials to the schools? Do they care about recreation? Do they care about returning anything to their customers? They certainly take from us with some of the highest water rates in the state. They should reconsider their plan to destroy Brush Valley and make it a recreational preserve for the consumers who provide them with the profits. Give something back to the people instead of just taking from the people. Philadelphia Suburban should follow the lead of PPL. Take the profits, but give a little back. We're not asking for that much.
